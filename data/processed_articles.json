In this situation, Supreme Court lawyer Fazlur Rahman spoke to newspersons at the court premises on Monday afternoon. Expressing concern for the safety of himself and his wife and children, he said, “O people of Bangladesh, I fought for you 54 years ago. Today, the very children who chant slogans against me—I fought to create an independent country for you. Do I deserve a dishonourable death at your hands?” Fazlur Rahman said, “If you think I am speaking against the country or opposing your actions, file a case against me, arrest me, punish me",

The study was conducted last May, based on the opinions of 33,207 individuals from 8,067 families. The PPRC highlighted that the country is currently facing the combined impact of three types of crises: Covid-19 (2020–2022), inflation, and political-economic uncertainty. It also noted that while bribery has decreased since last August, it has not stopped. Before August 2024, 8.54 per cent of respondents reported paying bribes to receive services.

Discussions must not remain limited to GDP alone; we need to expand debates to include equity, justice, inclusivity, and citizen welfare.” He further said that five new vulnerable areas demand special attention in the existing reality. First, the growing burden of chronic illnesses calls for a new kind of social protection programme. Second, female-headed households, which still remain at the bottom of society, require special support. Third, rising burden of debt is becoming a major concern",

Neither Hasina nor the Indian government has clarified under what legal status she is there — as a political refugee or under some special arrangement. What is clear, however, is that she is there, and living comfortably. An Indian online portal, The Print, has provided a detailed account of their stay, part of which was republished in Prothom Alo. According to that report, former state minister Mohammad Arafat said they are working day and night to figure out how Sheikh Hasina can be restored to power. He is not alone.

The failure to take any effective international measures for resolving the Rohingya crisis, particularly due to the stance of powerful South Asian countries such as India and China regarding Myanmar’s accountability. There are certain political, legal, and diplomatic reasons behind the Bangladesh government’s decision not to grant the Rohingya population formal recognition as refugees. Bangladesh is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol. Therefore, under international law, the Bangladesh government had no legal obligation to grant refugee status to the Rohingyas who arrived in 2017",

Instead, Bangladesh defined them as “Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals.” As a sovereign state, Bangladesh has allowed the Rohingyas to live not as refugees, but as temporary asylum-seekers. While this process has drawn humanitarian assistance from the international community, it does not oblige Bangladesh to provide them with permanent settlement. Furthermore, the then Bangladesh government believed that by not granting the Rohingyas refugee status, it was diplomatically sending a message to Myanmar that the Rohingyas’ permanent home lies in Myanmar",

By opening its borders and providing shelter to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas in several phases, Bangladesh on the one hand set an example of fulfilling humanitarian responsibility. On the other hand, the long-term sheltering of such a vast displaced population has placed Bangladesh under economic and political pressure, due to increased population burden in Cox’s Bazar and Chattogram, environmental damage, economic strain, and a rise in criminal activities. The objective behind the decision not to recognise the Rohingyas as “refugees” has, to a large extent, failed due to various internal and international complexities",

While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority.

The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north",

Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said",

Speaking at an international conference titled, \"Stakeholders' Dialogue: Takeaways to the High-Level Conference on Rohingya Situation\", in Cox's Bazar, Andrew stressed that while the UN provides a vital platform to lay out facts and truths, the success of interventions depends on the political will and engagement of member states. \"While a global arms embargo by the UN Security Council may not be immediately achievable, member states can act independently when they receive verified information,\" he said. Andrew described how his report revealed that hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of weapons materials were being funnelled through Singapore to Myanmar's military. Singapore launched an investigation, supported by the UN rapporteur, leading to a 90 percent reduction in such exports",

He also expressed his gratitude to the Rohingya community for their resilience and active advocacy, particularly recognising community leaders for their persistent efforts to uphold human rights, dignity, and quality of life. Andrew praised Bangladesh for providing refuge to Rohingya refugees during the 2017 crisis, stating that the country's swift humanitarian response likely saved countless lives",

The Israeli military alleged that Anas al-Sharif -- a prominent Al Jazeera correspondent killed in the strike -- headed a Hamas \"terrorist cell\" and was \"responsible for advancing rocket attacks\" against Israelis. The CPJ slammed that strike, saying journalists should never be targeted in war. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Israel's offensive has killed at least 62,744 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable. মৌসুমি বায়ুর প্রভাবে যে বৃষ্টিপাত হয়, সেটা অন্যান্য বছরের মতোই ছিল। তবে...",

Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said \"the toll so far is 20 martyrs, including five journalists and one member of the civil defence,\" after strikes hit Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis -- a large medical complex in the south that has been targeted several times by Israel since the start of the war. According to media watchdogs, around 200 journalists have been killed in nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas. In a statement, the Israeli military said its troops on Monday \"carried out a strike in the area of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis.\" \"The Chief of the General Staff instructed to conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" it said, adding it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such\".

While there were a few signs of rustiness at times on Sunday, Djokovic also laced his performance with flashes of the brilliance that has been his calling card throughout a glittering career. Djokovic looked to be a man in a hurry in a scorching start, rattling off winners to take the first set 6-1. Tien was given hope in a laboured second set from Djokovic, but the 19-year-old American could not convert a break point that would have made it one set all",

Instead, Djokovic held serve to make it 5-5 in the second set and reasserted himself to claim the second-set tie break, attacking the net cleverly and using some sublime variation to pull Tien all over the court. Djokovic paused for a medical timeout for treatment to his right foot before the third set got under way. The rest appeared to give Djokovic a jolt of energy and he sprinted into a 5-1 lead to leave Tien reeling. Tien did well to save a match point on Djokovic's serve before breaking for 5-2. But the respite was short-lived as Djokovic again responded emphatically, breaking back immediately to wrap up victory. \"I wish I had Learner Tien's age -- when you come to the late 30s it's about learning how to preserve the energy for what matters,\" Djokovic said",

Goals in each half from Tasos Douvikas and starlet Nico Paz, the latter a stunning free-kick in the 73rd minute, were enough for Como to take all three points at the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia.

World number one Sabalenka, who is bidding to become the first woman to win back-to-back US Open titles since Serena Williams completed a hat-trick of wins in 2014, was made to work hard en route to a 7-5, 6-1 victory over Switzerland's Rebeka Masarova. Sabalenka will face unseeded Russian Polina Kudermetova in the second round. Tjen won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, and will now face Britain's former US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the second round. While Sabalenka was the highest-ranked women's player in action on Sunday, the men's tournament saw American fourth and sixth seeds Fritz and Shelton ease into the second round",
