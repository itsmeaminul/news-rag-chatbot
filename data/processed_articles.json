The latest move would create new hurdles for international students, exchange workers and foreign journalists who would have to apply to extend their stay in the US rather than maintain a more flexible legal status. The proposed regulation would create a fixed time period for F visas for international students, J visas that allow visitors on cultural exchange programs to work in the US, and I visas for members of the media. Those visas are currently available for the duration of the program or U.S.-based employment. There were about 1.6 million international students on F visas in the US in 2024, according to US government data",

This reflects a general deficiency in emotional development during the critical adolescent years. 2.

Yet, amid the emphasis on cognitive progress and infrastructural development, there remains a largely unaddressed but crucial gap in our national discourse: emotional intelligence, especially among our adolescents. This writing is based on a study titled “Emotional Intelligence: A Regional Study Based on Rural and Urban Adolescents of Bangladesh”, with a focus on understanding how emotional intelligence varies across socio-economic classes, gender, academic performance, and family structure. The findings indicate that emotional development is being overlooked—both at the family level and in institutional systems—which may have long-term implications for Bangladesh’s broader developmental goals. The questionnaire consisted of 37 questions, segmented into three parts: academic activities and performance, socio-economic profile (including parental occupation, education, and marital status), and emotional intelligence assessment",

Around 12:15 pm, a team of police from Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) arrived, and the protesters handed over at least 15 people, including former lawmaker Abdul Latif Siddique and Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, to the police. Former MP Abdul Latif Siddiqui said, “I had no idea there would be any problem here. I came only because I was invited to this event.” When asked why the roundtable participants were confined and handed over to police, a man named Al Amin Rasel said, “We are the July Fighters.

We want every vote to count, even if it is just one percent. But in reality, even if someone secures 25 percent of the votes, while others receive 24 or 23 percent, they cannot play any role in the government. As a result, nearly 75 percent of the votes are wasted.\" \"Our Ameer has demanded that the election be held in February. We will only participate if a level playing field is ensured. We will not leave this country to vote-rigging thieves. The polling centres and ballot boxes must be guarded. Jamaat will present the people of this country with a welfare state,\" added the Jamaat leader",

The USDA forecasts that rice imports by both the public and private sectors may rise 8 percent year-on-year to 12 lakh tonnes in MY26, which begins in May. \"Domestic rice prices have reached an all-time high,\" the USDA noted, adding that the government is stepping up imports to ease market prices. In mid-July, the government announced plans to purchase 400,000 tonnes of rice through international tenders for public granaries. On August 10, the food ministry authorised 242 firms to import 500,000 tonnes in order to increase supply and curb price hikes of the staple grain. The USDA report, citing its sources, said Bangladesh imported around 200,000 tonnes of rice in the first three months of MY26 since May",

Prices of all rice varieties in Bangladesh have continued to climb, reaching the highest levels ever recorded in July 2025. The average retail price of coarse rice in July 2025 stood at Tk 57.5 per kilogramme, up 12.3 percent from the same period the previous year, the report said, citing market data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). That same month, the average retail price of high-quality non-aromatic (fine) rice was 12.7 percent higher year-on-year at Tk 80 per kilogramme. \"The price increase is primarily due to higher paddy production and milling costs, overall inflation, and inefficiencies in the supply chain",

The USDA projected a 2 percent year-on-year increase in rice production to 3.75 lakh tonnes in MY26, supported by favourable weather. It estimated that farmers harvested 2.05 crore tonnes of rice during the Boro season, the country's principal crop. Yields and overall Boro production were robust as there were no droughts, heatwaves, cyclones, significant pest damage, or other natural disasters, the USDA observed",

Lower international prices and stable supply are likely to underpin higher wheat imports, the second staple after rice. \"In Bangladesh, wheat is used to some extent as an alternative to rice.

In such cases, a bridge 100 meters in length will be considered equivalent to 2.5 kilometres of distance. This artificially increases the route length on paper, and fares rise accordingly. Sources said that East Zone Railway has proposed introducing the pontage charge on routes with bridges 100 meters or longer.

It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began.

The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal.

Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low",

A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data.

On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW.

According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday.

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said",

The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed",

It isn't cutting-edge. And that's the point. It's a quiet project. One where a counter got smaller so a tree could live. One where an architect didn't try to impress anyone — he just refused to erase what was already there. Zaman didn't build for the portfolio. He built for the space. That's the story.
