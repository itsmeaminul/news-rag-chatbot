The students carried out their pre-announced programme titled \"Long March to Dhaka.\" As part of this, around 11:00am, they began gathering on the main road at Shahbagh, causing traffic in and around the area to come to a halt. Around 1:30pm, the students started marching toward Jamuna, the residence of the Chief Adviser. As they attempted to cross the intersection near the InterContinental Hotel, police intervened. A clash ensued, with both sides chasing each other",

The matter was raised during the meeting in Beijing, paving the way for the purchase to be implemented. Talks between the two countries on the issue have been continuing since the visit.

Asked about the plan to purchase J-10C fighter aircraft from China, retired Major General ANM Muniruzzaman, president of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), told Prothom Alo that the aircraft’s success in the short India-Pakistan conflict in May had proven its technological capabilities. This purchase, he said, would significantly enhance Bangladesh’s defence capacity. On the other hand, it could also create challenges in the realm of international relations. He further said Bangladesh should proceed with caution in this procurement",

Mirza Fakhrul remarked that a quarter within the government is deliberately trying to prevent pro-democracy forces from coming to power. He stressed that much more needs to be done to achieve the desired goal",

A suspension would mean India national teams and clubs being barred from all international competitions. FIFA previously suspended India in August 2022 for third-party influence after the Supreme Court appointed a committee of administrators to run the AIFF. The ban was lifted a few days later, paving the way for the AIFF to elect Chaubey. India's top-flight club football is currently in disarray. The Indian Super League (ISL) could fold over a dispute between the AIFF and its commercial partner.

Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter",

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said",

During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election",

It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said",

The devices include MRI, CT Scan, X-ray and radiotherapy machines, they added. SUFFERINGS OF PATIENTS Sixty-one-year-old Sakina Begum travelled to Dhaka from Patuakhali in mid-July, seeking better medical care. Doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) advised her on July 28 to undergo radiotherapy without delay. But she had to wait nearly three weeks to receive the service as two of the three radiotherapy machines at the country's largest hospital have been non-functional for years. \"Had all three machines been operational, my mother could have received treatment on time,\" said Sakina's son Hadis Khan on Monday",

HOW WILL THE SYSTEM WORK? Two officials of NEMEMW & TC said they will install monitoring devices on medical equipment to track electricity consumption levels for each machine. Explaining the mechanism, they said a piece of equipment consumes a certain amount of electricity under normal conditions, and the level of consumption increases when it is in use.

The BNP leader said his party had fully cooperated with the interim government since its inception and had neither created obstacles nor raised demands on the streets to embarrass it. \"But, unfortunately, some political quarters are intentionally trying to foil and disrupt the polls by raising new demands,\" he said.

Seventh seed Djokovic broke for a 4-2 lead in the second set on the way to levelling up the match in bright sunshine on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic dropped serve early in the third set but then rattled off five consecutive games to grab the set after falling 3-1 behind. With Svajda wilting and receiving treatment to both legs, Djokovic pulled away to victory by winning 11 of the final 12 games to register a record-tying 191st hard-court match win at Grand Slams. He also surpassed the mark he shared with Roger Federer by making the last 32 of a major for the 75th time. He will next play Britain's Cam Norrie or Francisco Comesana of Argentina",

While Australia fell to a 2-1 series defeat at home against South Africa, the reigning ICC Men's Cricket World Cup winners were rewarded on the latest rankings release following their emphatic victory in the series finale in Mackay. The Aussies amassed a whopping total of 431/2 in the 50-over contest, with a trio of their batters in Travis Head (142), Mitch Marsh (100) and Cameron Green (118*) cashing in with a century. All three made good ground on the rankings for ODI batters as a result, with Head gaining one place to move to equal 11th, Marsh jumping four rungs to move to 44th and Green rising a whopping 40 slots to be 78th. Australian teammate Josh Inglis also makes ground on the list for ODI batters, with the right-hander improving 23 spots to move to 64th as a result of his innings of 87 during the second match of the series against the Proteas",

While England have had mixed results of late and currently sit in fourth place in the ICC World Test Championship standings following their recent 2-2 against India at home, Langer wants to see the side take a different approach when they arrive in Australia later this year in the battle for the Ashes across five Tests. Langer believes England have been dictated to by Australia's bowlers in recent away tours and wants to see their batters take on the high quality Aussie pace attack when the first Test commences in Perth on November 21. \"Call it Bazball or the aggressive approach, but I think England must play that approach in Australia",

FHP: Our strength is that everyone knows we can only succeed as a team, not as individuals. Joty is a fantastic player, but she knows she can't win matches alone. In our victories, contributions have come from across the side. We don't have a super batter striking at 100-150 to finish games single-handedly, but our spin attack is world-class. The weakness is pace -- if the board invests in developing fast bowlers, we could become a much more complete side",

Havertz has been sidelined since picking up an injury during a 1-0 Premier League win at Manchester United earlier this month, and was absent when Arsenal beat Leeds United at home in the weekend. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said last week more time and tests were needed to gain clarity on Havertz's injury.

Swiatek also attended Swift's money-spinning 'Eras Tour' last year, attending a concert in Liverpool following her victory at the French Open -- a win that earned her a handwritten note of congratulations from the singer.
