Highlighting the fast-changing global landscape, Touhid pointed to three defining events reshaping geopolitics: the Ukraine war, the genocide in Gaza, and rising US-China tensions. He noted that Western public opinion, especially in the United States, is shifting significantly in support of the Palestinian cause, with growing voices even within Jewish intellectual circles condemning Israeli actions in Gaza. On South Asia, he observed that US-India ties, once framed around containing China, appear to be undergoing recalibration. He cautioned, however, against assuming permanent shifts, saying that the \"geopolitical basics remain unchanged\" even amid talk of new alignments involving India, China and Russia",

He reminded that nearly a million young Rohingyas, many now in their late teens and early twenties, cannot be expected to remain confined to camps indefinitely. \"It is absolutely naive to think they will accept a hopeless life forever. If unresolved, the crisis will spill beyond Bangladesh and become a serious regional and possibly global security issue,\" he cautioned.

    "text": ". When COVID-19 hit and buyers walked away, USD 3 billion in orders vanished almost overnight—laying bare the fragility of a model built on dependence. Why is the OEM trap a big problem? Three reasons stand out-A) Value capture: Without own designs or brands, local firms forfeit the richest parts of the value chain—branding, distribution and margins. B) Vulnerability: Contract manufacturers are exposed to sudden order cancellations, shifting sourcing strategies, and price competition from lower-cost countries. C) Stunted capability-building: When firms focus on speed and cost, they under-invest in R&D, design teams, marketing and IP—skills that take years to develop. Not every country stays stuck. Taiwan’s semiconductor story proves it. Decades ago, the island was mostly assembling chips for others—a role not unlike OEM manufacturing. But Taiwan made a bold bet: government-backed R&D and deep collaboration between universities and industry",

Institutions like ITRI worked hand in hand with academia to train talent, develop technology, and push beyond simple assembly. The result? Companies like TSMC emerged, not just making chips but designing them, owning the intellectual property, and leading the global market. Taiwan didn’t settle for chasing orders—it built an ecosystem of innovation. The leap from low-margin manufacturing to tech powerhouse didn’t happen overnight, but it happened because the country chose design, skills, and IP over dependence. So how can Bangladesh begin to break the trap? The answer rests largely on a pragmatic, scaled-up model of academia–industry partnerships—but not as one-off trainings or charity projects. It needs to be a systemic pipeline that turns classrooms and research labs into launchpads for commercial design and brand-building",

Here’s how that plays out in practice- [a] Build skill pipelines, not just seminars. Universities need to move beyond theory and co-create curriculums with manufacturers—producing designers, technologists, and product managers who understand today’s supply chains. Quick workshops like chip design or fabric innovation bootcamps help, but they’re no substitute for semester-long project courses and mandatory internships that put students inside real factories and brand teams. [b] Turn labs into launchpads. Select university labs should become shared prototyping hubs—think fashion-tech labs, textile material centers, sustainable-dyeing facilities—where manufacturers co-fund pilot projects. These hubs must run on clear IP-sharing rules so the designs born there can actually hit the market, not gather dust in journals. [c] Lock up the ideas, not the progress",

It protects the innovators, builds trust, and keeps the ideas flowing instead of being swallowed by big buyers.

Roberts said the film did not advocate any one point of view. \"We are challenging people to have conversations and to be excited by that or to be infuriated by that, it's up to you,\" she said",

Three years ago, Park won a best director award at Cannes for \"Decision to Leave\", a critically acclaimed romantic thriller. The veteran director was last in Venice in 2005 with \"Lady Vengeance\", part of a trilogy exploring the dark recesses of the human experience.

Thursday brought the return of Oscar winner Emma Stone in Yorgos Lanthimos's darkly satirical \"Bugonia\", about two conspiracy-obsessed misfits who kidnap a pharmaceutical company CEO. Stone and Greek director Lanthimos, working together for a fifth production, are hoping to repeat their successful formula from 2023 when \"Poor Things\" nabbed Venice's top Golden Lion prize. Variety called Bugonia \"riveting\", saying Lanthimos was \"at the top of his visionary nihilistic game\", while Time magazine said Stone could \"do no wrong\". George Clooney's turn as an ageing Hollywood star struggling with his career choices in Netflix-produced \"Jay Kelly\" by Noah Baumbach drew less favourable reviews. The Guardian called it \"a dire, sentimental and self-indulgent film\". Another hotly awaited film, to be shown Sunday, is Olivier Assayas's \"The Wizard of the Kremlin\", in which British star Jude Law portrays Russian President Vladimir Putin during his ascent to power",

They kicked me with their boots, beat me, and at one point a police officer struck me on the head with a helmet.” On Wednesday, police fired sound grenades, tear gas shells and opened water cannons at protesting engineering students in front of the Hotel InterContinental, as they marched towards the chief adviser’s residence, Jamuna. Similarly, fact-checking platform ‘Dismislab’ published a report on their website today stating that the photo of the BUET student being restrained was not produced using AI. I had become somewhat disoriented, and then I realised that I was being beaten continuously, mostly from behind.” Following the assault on engineering students, DMP Commissioner Sheikh Md Sajjat Ali approached protesting students at Shahbagh intersection on Wednesday night to apologise and assured them that a committee would be formed to take necessary action.",

At the core of their demands is the abolition of the reserved quota in government jobs for diploma holders in engineering. They assert that engineering positions and titles should be reserved exclusively for graduate engineers. Considering the international context, there is little reason to disagree with these demands. The administration should have promptly engaged in dialogue with the protesters to establish order in the country’s engineering sector. Instead, the police attacked them, creating a bloody scene that further complicated the situation. Meanwhile, diploma engineers are also demonstrating.

    "text": "Engineering students from across the country gathered at Shahbagh on Wednesday to press for a three-point demand. At the core of their demands is the abolition of the reserved quota in government jobs for diploma holders in engineering. They assert that engineering positions and titles should be reserved exclusively for graduate engineers. Considering the international context, there is little reason to disagree with these demands. The administration should have promptly engaged in dialogue with the protesters to establish order in the country’s engineering sector. Instead, the police attacked them, creating a bloody scene that further complicated the situation. Meanwhile, diploma engineers are also demonstrating. They want to be recognised as engineers and seek increased placement in appropriate engineering roles. Some of their other demands stem from conflicting interests, which graduate engineers oppose",

An integrated teamwork between engineers and diploma engineers is essential for the industrialisation and development of the country. Engineering tasks should be handled by engineers, just as technical tasks within engineering should be handled by diploma engineers. The work of both groups complements each other. Therefore, instead of rivalry, there should be a fair distribution of responsibilities. Both parties should sit and resolve issues to work together for the advancement of the engineering sector. We must understand that the title ‘engineer’ is not an inherited designation. In developed countries, one cannot use the title solely based on academic qualifications. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree, one must pass a professional examination and meet a certain level of professional competence to be recognised as an engineer",

When they sign off on engineering work, approve designs, or conduct inspections, it can be assumed that they have done so while upholding the standards of professional responsibility and credibility. Engineers are required to follow a code of ethics, which includes a commitment to avoid corruption, bias, and negligence, and to maintain transparency. They are legally accountable for their work. If an engineer fails to fulfill their assigned duties, they risk losing their licence and the right to identify themselves as an engineer. The number of public and private universities in the country offering engineering degrees has increased.

Regardless of the level of academic qualification, no one should be allowed to use the title 'engineer' without a licence. Without an up-to-date licence, even diploma engineers—and, in practice, even bachelor's degree holders—should not be permitted to use the engineering title. Currently, the entry-level position for graduate engineers is at the 9th grade, while for diploma engineers it is at the 10th grade.

This represents a major form of discrimination against graduate engineers and poses a serious concern for the engineering sector. The question arises: can diploma engineers be appointed to positions designated for graduate engineers? The answer is ‘no.’ Diploma engineers are not trained to work as professional engineers. Their field of work is different. Therefore, a separate parallel career track should be established immediately for diploma engineers in terms of recruitment, posting, and promotion.

Some 80 core trainers are participating in the two-day training programme, who will later provide training to TOTs (Trainers of Trainers) ahead of the upcoming national election to be held before next Ramadan in February 2026. Pointing at the election officials, the CEC said, “We want 100 per cent neutral behaviour.” The CEC asked them to be ready to face new challenges like to check abuse of social media, misinformation and disinformation alongside the law and order challenge in the upcoming election. Election Commission Abdur Rahmanel Masud stressed the need for performing the election duty by the officials following the constitution and the electoral laws. “Whether I can carry out the responsibility entrusted to me properly in line with the laws, which could be the only thing that should be the matter of our consideration,” he said pointing at the election officials",

The same mantra, the election is a trap of the bourgeoisie. There is no emancipation liberation through elections. Armed revolution is a must. This is what Chairman Mao Zedong has taught us.

The constitutional body unveiled its work plan yesterday, Thursday, outlining the roadmap for the upcoming polls. The plan specifies tentative timelines for completing major preparations, including dialogues among stakeholders, finalising the voter list, revising electoral laws and regulations, registering new political parties, and demarcating constituencies—altogether 24 key tasks.

The constitutional body unveiled its work plan yesterday, Thursday, outlining the roadmap for the upcoming polls. The plan specifies tentative timelines for completing major preparations, including dialogues among stakeholders, finalising the voter list, revising electoral laws and regulations, registering new political parties, and demarcating constituencies—altogether 24 key tasks. BNP has welcomed the announcement of the election roadmap. However, National Citizens’ Party (NCP) said moving toward elections without first ensuring the legal and constitutional foundation of the July Charter amounts to reneging on earlier government commitments. Jamaat-e-Islami described the roadmap as conventional and somewhat misleading",

The interim government and EC had earlier indicated that the 13th parliamentary election would be held before Ramadan (in the first half of February 2026). With that goal in mind, the EC formally announced its work plan. However, the roadmap does not mention the exact date of the election schedule. At a press conference held at the EC building in Agargaon yesterday afternoon, Senior Secretary of the EC Secretariat Akhtar Ahmed announced the plan. In response to questions about the election schedule and polling date, he said the schedule would be announced 60 days before polling. He added that the Chief Adviser’s Office has instructed the EC to organise the election before Ramadan, which begins on 17 or 18 February. When asked about demands for a Constituent Assembly and referendum, the secretary said the Chief Adviser’s directive is limited to the national election",

According to the EC’s work plan, reforms to laws and regulations, registration of new political parties, and finalisation of constituency boundaries are to be completed by 30 September. The draft of constituency delimitation has already been published, with the final gazette to be issued by 15 September and the GIS maps by 30 September.

But Bangladesh tasted a shocking defeat to the Netherlands during the ICC ODI World Cup in 2023 in India. Despite their good track record against the Netherlands, Bangladesh captain Liton Das refused to take anything for granted, saying that they are looking to bring up their best cricket in the upcoming series. \"An international match is always challenging. There is no big or small team here,\" Liton said ahead of the match. \"If we get a chance to check a few players, we will do that, but at the same time, we'll play to win,\" he added, hinting at some experiments in the series, keeping the Asia Cup in mind. Bangladesh have been training in Sylhet for the last 10 days. The practice camp was moved to Sylhet from Dhaka mainly to keep the run-fest nature of UAE wickets in mind",

Liton also believes that the preparation in Sylhet will be useful to adapt to UAE wickets. \"When we play in the Asia Cup, we'll get different teams. We will not be able to bring the teams who will play the Asia Cup here.\" \"But I think the conditions will be similar. Because we all know, UAE produces good batting wickets. Sylhet is also a batting-friendly wicket to a large extent.\" A series victory against the Netherlands is expected, but a defeat will draw flak. Liton remains pragmatic about any kind of result. \"As I said earlier, in international cricket there is no small team. Bangladesh have lost to different teams before - nothing new. If we lose, we lose. What matters is how well we play.\" Netherlands captain Scott Edwards admits that Bangladesh are very strong on their home ground, but he believes his side is capable of winning the series",

Propaganda is being spread against us as if we oppose reform. But it was BNP that first called for reform. Whatever reforms have happened in Bangladesh have come through BNP,” he said.

The event was presided over by poet, journalist, and BNP Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Abdul Hai Sikder. Mahdi Amin, adviser to BNP’s acting chairman Tarique Rahman, was the keynote speaker",

Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent",

Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said",

According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday",

Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election.

But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages",

The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country",

But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday.

Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan smashed five sixes and a four in his whirlwind 16-ball 39 but fell to Rauf to end his team's fight. Earlier, Pakistan was lifted by Agha's fourth T20I half century. Agha anchored the innings admirably well after opener Sahibzada Farhan smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 10-ball 21 after Pakistan won the toss and batted. Agha added 53 for the fifth wicket with Nawaz whose 11-ball 21 had two sixes and a boundary as the duo helped Pakistan get 51 runs in the last five overs. Pakistan play hosts United Arab Emirates on Saturday. All three teams face other each other twice with the top two playing the September 7 final. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

The Briton, who had swept through her first two rounds without dropping serve, was repeatedly undone by errors and found no answers as Rybakina closed out the set. The second set followed a similar script. Raducanu's first service game slipped away with another flurry of mistakes, and Rybakina capitalised with a straightforward hold to consolidate. The Kazakh landed just 47% of her first serves, yet Raducanu was unable to make any inroads against the second delivery. The 22-year-old briefly lifted the crowd by saving two break points, greeted by a loud cheer of encouragement. But the reprieve was short-lived as Rybakina dragged her across the baseline before finishing the rally with a forehand winner out of reach, breaking again as Raducanu vented her frustration by swiping her racquet",

Very happy that we executed our collective plans at the death,\" said Madushanka, who held his nerve with the last three balls to close out the win. Zimbabwe won the toss and Sri Lanka posted 298-6 batting first courtesy of a late barrage of boundaries. The second ODI is on Sunday at the same venue. Sri Lanka recovered from losing opener Nishan Madushka for a duck as Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis (38) put on 100 runs for the second wicket. Nissanka top scored with 76 and, further down the order, Janith Liyanage struck an unbeaten 70 off just 47 balls. Kamindu Mendis also provided some late-order impetus with a 36-ball 57 before being bowled by Ngarava from the final ball of the innings. Left-arm quick Ngarava (2-34) was the lone Zimbabwe bowler to take more than one wicket at Harare Sports Club",

The home team's reply began disastrously with Brian Bennett and Brendan Taylor both falling to Fernando in the first over, leaving Zimbabwe 0-2 after just four balls. Taylor was making his first ODI appearance since 2021 after bans for breaching anti-corruption rules and for failing a drugs test. But half-centuries from Ben Curran (70) and Sean Williams (57) dragged Zimbabwe back into contention before they slipped to 161-5. But Raza combined with Tony Munyonga in a brilliant 128-run stand to take the Africans to the brink of victory. Raza's 92 came off 87 balls and included eight fours. When he was dismissed by Madushanka, Munyonga was left stranded at the non-striker's end until the penultimate ball and finished 43 not out.

Malaysia, who had struck in every quarter against Bangladesh in the 2022 edition, bounced back nine minutes later with Ashran Hamsani levelling the margin from open play in the 25th minute. Since then, they established control in the match and made it 2-1 before the half-time break as Akhimullah Anuar scored from open play in the 36th minute. Bangladesh, who lacked fitness following a short preparation, denied Malaysia in the third quarter but could not resist the speedy opponents in the final stages, conceding two more goals through Muhajir Abu Rauf and Syed Cholan in the 48th and 54th minutes, respectively. Bangladesh are grouped with Malaysia, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in Pool B fixtures of the eight-team tournament. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",
