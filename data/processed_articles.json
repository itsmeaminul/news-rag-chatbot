Afterwards, the organisers screened a documentary on the July Uprising and the overall situation in Bangladesh. On the first day of the conference, five working sessions took place along with several keynote addresses and special sessions. Delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session, Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that Bangladesh must bring change to its political culture, and a new definition of political culture must be set. At the same time, institutions of Bangladesh must be strengthened. Politics should not only be about the desire to come to power but about nation-building, institution-building, improving education, and fostering opportunities for the younger generation. Touhid Hossain further said the youth who initiated this change will not allow the country to return to the pre-2024 political reality",

Touhid Hossain further said the youth who initiated this change will not allow the country to return to the pre-2024 political reality. “Perhaps they (the youth) cannot implement it right now, because politics is still in the hands of our generation—those who are clinging to power. But they will not last long. The youth may make mistakes, but they have vitality and a willingness to learn. They will gain experience—maybe through difficult paths—but they will learn, and we will see change.” In his welcome remarks, Professor Mushtaq Khan, economist at SOAS University of London, said that the July Uprising, led by mass participation, brought about change in Bangladesh, and among the organisations created in its aftermath is DAIRA, the conference organiser",

He noted that one year after the uprising, many express frustration—some with political parties, some with the interim government’s achievements, some with law and order, others with the reform process, and some with the trial of perpetrators. Yet Mushtaq Khan emphasised the achievements of 2024. He said it’s true that there are frustrations but he wanted to stress Bangladesh’s enormous achievement in 2024. An uprising led by unarmed people toppled one of the most violent, repressive, bloodthirsty governments in the region. Bangladesh is a country that has repeatedly ousted autocratic regimes through new movements. He added that the fascist state structures have not changed, which is a matter of concern and disappointment for many citizens and students. But he expressed optimism that Bangladesh’s politicians now understand that returning to the old political arrangement is impossible—people will not accept it",

This is because such structures cannot ensure employment, health, or education. People will not compromise with their current demands. Politics, he said, must become more open. It is not only about amending parts of the constitution, but about examining where parties get their funding, to whom they are accountable, and how power structures are built. Mahfuz Anam, Editor and Publisher of The Daily Star, said, “Bangladeshis dream big, but we have failed at institution-building. We use democracy to gain power, but once in power, we begin to destroy democracy. Sadly, that is the history of Bangladesh.” “No matter how good a democratic framework you build, if its practitioners do not believe in democracy, it is bound to fail. Unless political parties internalise tolerance, dialogue, and a culture of working together, democracy cannot survive",

Liton and Saif combined for a 46 off 26 for the undefeated third wicket stand to sail the side home and take 1-0 lead in the series. Opener Parvez Hossain Emon scored 15 runs in the first over to give Bangladesh a fluent start in chasing. However, he was dismissed in the third over, without adding any runs to his 15. His fellow opener Tanzid Hasan Tamim scored 29 and added 66-run with Liton for the second wicket to edge the side closer to the victory before Tim Pringle had Tanzid caught by Max O'Dowd at long on. That mattered little as Saif gave Liton ably support in sealing the deal quite comfortably. Earlier Taskin's third four-wicket haul and second against Netherlands since his 4-25 in Hobart during 2022 T20 World Cup, broke the spine of the Netherlands. Saif Hasan also bowled impeccably to make the matter worse for the visitors",

Mustafizur Rahman picked up just one but strangled Netherlands batters with tight line and length that saw him conceded just 19 runs in four overs. But after being put into bat first, Netherlands made a fluent start, thanks to opener Max O'Dowd who went after Bangladesh bowlers in aggressive fashion. Taskin Ahmed provided the breakthrough, dismissing O'Dowd after he made 15 ball-23 with three fours and one six. He followed it up with the wicket of another opener Vikramjit Singh, ending his painstaking stay in the crease. Saif Hasan struck twice in his first over, getting rid of captain Scott Edwards (12) and Teja Nidmanuru who top-scored for Netherlands with 26. Those two blows left Netherlands to 68-4 in 10th over. Netherlands batters could never recover from that collapse as they lost wickets at regular interval. The second match is on Monday at the same venue.",

From the tenure of Manmohan Singh through to that of Narendra Modi, Indian policymakers felt comfortable with Sheikh Hasina in power and sought to ensure her continued survival in office. According to him, the Modi government regarded Sheikh Hasina as India’s most reliable partner",

Simultaneously, Modi turned a blind eye to the instrumentalisation of Bangladesh in India’s domestic politics. Reflecting on the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, Siddharth Varadarajan noted that during the first 24 hours, the scenes emerging from Bangladesh were dominated by the celebratory mood surrounding Sheikh Hasina’s downfall, alongside reports of child killings and student killings. Yet, after the first 24 hours, Indian media began reporting that large-scale communal riots were under way, that Hindus were under attack, temples were being vandalised, and even that genocide was occurring. To this end, fake footage was disseminated, and artificial intelligence was deployed. He stated that the Indian government intentionally permitted such rumours to proliferate",

Casting the July Uprising as an “anti-Hindu conspiracy” carried an overtly political message. Some claimed it was orchestrated by Pakistan, others attributed it to the United States “deep state”, while yet others blamed Jamaat-e-Islami. Thus, not only did this narrative obscure the failures of the Modi government’s foreign policy, it also deepened divisions within Indian society itself. Varadarajan concluded that, overall, the Indian government was content with this framing, for it shifted public attention away from the failures of Modi’s foreign policy.",

The man in the red shirt attacked Samrat, a central leader of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad,” he alleged. He also accused both the army and the police of involvement in the assault. “The army is involved in the attack on us, and the police played their part too. On whose orders did the army take to the streets and leave us bloodied? The Army Chief must investigate and take action against those responsible.” Clashes broke out between activists of the Jatiya Party (JaPa) and Gono Odhikar Parishad in the capital’s Kakrail area on Friday evening. The violence erupted when a procession by Gono Odhikar Parishad was passing in front of the JaPa’s office. Law enforcement later used batons, injuring Nurul Haque and several others",

The students’ three-point demand includes: recruitment to the grade-9 assistant engineer post only through examination, with BSc in Engineering as the minimum qualification; allowing higher-degree holders to apply for grade-10 posts, which are currently restricted to diploma holders; and, ensuring that only those who have completed a BSc in Engineering are permitted to use the professional title “Engineer.” The government has already formed a committee to examine the legitimacy of the demands of BSc engineering graduates and diploma degree holders and to prepare recommendations. On Tuesday afternoon, BUET students began a sit-in at Shahbagh intersection to press home their demands. The following day, around 11:00 am, they blocked the Shahbagh intersection as part of their pre-declared programme",

Zaman's client, Mahmood Ullah, had a clear ask; an outdoor coffee bar with seating, an exhibition space inside the old garage, and rooftop dining. Trees and ground cover were viewed as obstacles. But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it",

The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed. That one decision meant giving up a few seats in the café plan. But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design",

No saree exhibition or fashion runway today feels complete without these bold, contemporary style statements. In the latest design of Afsana Ferdousi, the immortal words of Banalata Sen find an unexpected new canvas: the folds of wedding couture. Ferdousi is celebrated for blending sustainability with a seamless fusion of modernity and tradition, and has reimagined Banalata Sen on the six-yard drape. This time, at the special request of a bride-to-be. In the poem, Jibanananda Das uses the image of a weary, long-travelled sailor as a central metaphor. The narrator describes himself as having wandered through the seas for \"a thousand years,\" crossing ancient oceans and lands — from the \"darkness of Ceylon\" to \"the seas of Malaya\" — before finding peace in the quiet gaze of Banalata Sen. In Ferdousi's hands, the saree's zamin and anchal become the sailor's final destination",

Umama is already a well-known figure on campus, particularly for her role during the July uprising, where she coordinated student mobilisation at Kabi Sufia Kamal Hall. Later, she became spokesperson of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, gaining wider recognition beyond campus, although she subsequently resigned amid controversies over allegations against other activists. Previously, Umama also served as member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Chhatra Federation, the student wing of Ganosamhati Andolan, before stepping down after the July uprising. She is a student of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (session 2018–19) and her panel has fielded candidates for all 28 DUCSU positions",

According to campus sources, seven left-leaning student organisations initially wanted Umama as their VP candidate, but she declined in order to run independently. On Friday, this correspondent spoke with several individuals involved in various activities including the formation of Umama Fatema’s panel. According to them, Umama Fatema’s strengths in the DUCSU elections lie in four areas. First, her panel may secure a significant portion of the female students’ votes, who account for nearly 48 per cent of the electorate. Second, with over seven thousand votes from science departments, Umama, being a science student herself, may succeed in attracting substantial support from that group. Third, her panel believes they are likely to receive a considerable share of votes from Jagannath Hall, which has 2,222 votes, around 6 per cent of the total",

Furthermore, she has not faced any major allegations of financial irregularities. However, panel insiders also acknowledged certain challenges. Aside from Umama and a few others, most candidates are not widely recognised. Several other panels also feature activists who were active during the July uprising, as well as female candidates, which could split the vote. Another factor is that nearly half the university’s students are non-residential, many of whom commute by bus. To appeal to this group, Umama’s panel nominated Rafiz Khan, a former president of the Chaitali bus route, for the position of transport secretary. His popularity among commuting students is considered an advantage. Campaigning is already underway",

Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention.

A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters",

They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]",

The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said",

Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent",

Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday.

Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal",

Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\".

The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver. We are searching for information on the driver,\" he told The Daily Star",

Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines.

Taskin impressed amongst the frontline bowlers and had help from part-time option Saif Hassan (2-18) who used his gentle off-spin to great effect -- removing skipper Scott Edwards (12 runs off seven balls) and Teja Nidamanuru (26 runs off 26 balls) in the 10th over -- which helped the Tigers maintain control throughout the innings.

The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country",

Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater",

The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used",

The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official",

As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars",

Milan fell to their first ever defeat to Cremonese at the san Siro last weekend but bounced back at the Stadio Via del Mare thanks to goals in the second half from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic. \"You can't just expect to win because you're wearing the Milan jersey.

Allegri also effectively confirmed that Christopher Nkunku has completed his move to Milan from Chelsea, referring to the France international as \"the new boy\" whose arrival should be announced officially on Saturday. Loftus-Cheek opened the scoring in the 66th minute when the England international got a glancing header to Luka Modric's floated free-kick.

Alcaraz's one hour 44-minute victory sends the 2022 US Open champion into a meeting on Sunday against France's Arthur Rinderknech, who defeated compatriot Benjamin Bonzi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. The five-time Grand Slam singles champion admitted he had been nervous about having to open the day's play at 11.30am local time. \"I'm not an early morning person so it's difficult for me to wake up in the morning,\" Alcaraz said. \"One of the good things today though I woke up early, did the warm up and felt good.\" Alcaraz needed a medical timeout while leading 5-4 in the second set for treatment on his right knee, but later said he had no injury concerns. Djokovic, 38, meanwhile, was clinical in his win over Norrie in the evening session, which sends him into a fourth round tie against German veteran Jan-Lennard Struff",

Shelton, 22, was leading 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 when he began to feel pain in his left shoulder",

In the women's draw, meanwhile, world number one and defending champion Sabalenka avenged her 2021 US Open semi-final defeat to Leylah Fernandez with a straight-sets victory over the Canadian 31st seed on Armstrong. Sabalenka was left distraught after being upset by the unheralded Fernandez four years ago with a place in what would have been her first Grand Slam final there for the taking. But the 27-year-old from Belarus made sure there was no repeat on Friday, seeing off Fernandez 6-3, 7-6 (7/2). Sabalenka's victory saw her extend her incredible winning streak in tie-breaks to 18. \"I wanted this revenge badly,\" Sabalenka said afterwards. \"It was a tough lesson for me back then. Since then, we never played again",

Australia's cricketers are awarded the dark green woollen caps before Test debuts and they are revered by players and fans alike. Arts Minister Tony Burke said the purchase safeguarded an important piece of national history. \"You'd be hard-pressed to meet an Australian that hasn't heard of the great Donald Bradman, arguably the greatest cricketer of all time,\" he said. \"Now to have one of his iconic baggy greens in the National Museum of Australia means visitors will have the opportunity to get up close and connect with our sporting and cultural history",

Skipper Bradman, who famously averaged 99.94 in Test matches, sported the cap during England's 1946-47 Ashes tour of Australia, the first to be played between the two sides after World War II. \"Sir Donald's baggy green marks the life of Australia's most celebrated batsman and reflects a time when sporting heroes gave Australians hope, following the heartbreak and hardship of World War II,\" she said late Friday. \"We are delighted this national treasure has found a home here at the National Museum of Australia for all Australians to enjoy.\" The cap, bought from a private owner, is one of 11 worn by Bradman known to exist. Australia's cricketers are awarded the dark green woollen caps before Test debuts and they are revered by players and fans alike",

There are no direct flights from Madrid to Almaty. Including transit time, Real Madrid will need to make a 12-hour journey to reach Kazakhstan's largest city.

That trip will span nearly 6,900 km -- the longest distance ever undertaken by a team in Champions League history. To play that match, Kairat Almaty will spend almost a full day on a plane, as both the outbound and return flights exceed 12 hours. Logistical planning will also be a major challenge for UEFA",

When asked if he would still be in the job when United visit Manchester City on September 14, Amorim said: \"I don't know what is going to happen. That is my idea, but I'm not going to promise you nothing, what is going to be in the future. \"But I'm the manager of Manchester United, and I think that is not going to change.\" Amorim responded to a question about his confidence in his ability to take United forward by simply saying: \"Yes.\" With a laugh, he added: \"It depends on the day. But I'm confident because I saw these players play really well in tough matches. And I see it in training. That training is so much better. \"I was not surprised, I was shocked in the last game, shocked. This game was not our team, the way we are doing things. So I'm always confident in the way I manage the team",

Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan smashed five sixes and a four in his whirlwind 16-ball 39 but fell to Rauf to end his team's fight. Earlier, Pakistan was lifted by Agha's fourth T20I half century. Agha anchored the innings admirably well after opener Sahibzada Farhan smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 10-ball 21 after Pakistan won the toss and batted. Agha added 53 for the fifth wicket with Nawaz whose 11-ball 21 had two sixes and a boundary as the duo helped Pakistan get 51 runs in the last five overs.

She raced to a 3-0 lead, her ball-striking consistently pushing Raducanu onto the back foot. The Briton, who had swept through her first two rounds without dropping serve, was repeatedly undone by errors and found no answers as Rybakina closed out the set. The second set followed a similar script. Raducanu's first service game slipped away with another flurry of mistakes, and Rybakina capitalised with a straightforward hold to consolidate. The Kazakh landed just 47% of her first serves, yet Raducanu was unable to make any inroads against the second delivery. The 22-year-old briefly lifted the crowd by saving two break points, greeted by a loud cheer of encouragement",

Rybakina then inched closer with an ace and sealed victory on the next point as Raducanu sent another shot long. The defeat ended Raducanu's most encouraging campaign at Flushing Meadows since she unexpectedly lifted the title in New York four years ago as a qualifier.

Industries Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, Chief Prosecutor of International Crimes Tribunal Tajul Islam, Chief of the CIED Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury, family members of the victims of enforced disappearances and human rights activists were present. Chief of Mission, OHCHR Huma Khan delivered welcome remarks while CIED member Nabila Idris made a keynote presentation. The United Nations said enforced disappearances have frequently been used as a strategy to spread terror within society. The feeling of insecurity generated by this practice is not limited to the close relatives of the disappeared, but also affects their communities and society as a whole",

Regarding false cases, he said they have withdrawn around 20, 000 politically motivated cases, but the stakeholders warned that militant and terrorism related cases should not be withdrawn. Nazrul assured the Commission that if they have concrete evidence regarding a false case that case will be withdrawn as soon as possible. He said no mistake can be made, and it requires huge scrutiny so that no militant is released. Adviser Adilur said the Commission has done a wonderful job and two reports have been submitted. \"We are waiting for the third report. We don't think it ends here.

Adilur said he strongly believes that the OHCHR and the Commission through their joint efforts will show a path to the people who are seeking justice for the cases of enforced disappearance, torture and extrajudicial killings. He said two tribunals are not enough to deal with the situation and the Chief Prosecutor may wonder whether there is a necessity for more tribunals. \"It is a very serious issue that the victims of the enforced disappearances are still continuing their struggle with the cases. We will look into it,\" Adilur said, hoping that the issue related to having access to bank accounts by the victims' families will also be resolved soon",

Regarding the law, Huma Khan said the progress has been slow and there are some challenges with the drafts that they have seen. \"I would like to urge the interim government to dissociate some issues from the law.\" One of the issues that should be not waiting for the law is an executive order that could help victims to access their property and their bank account, she said. \"The second issue that can help many victims who have been fortunate enough to come back alive, but have court cases against them……a lot of these cases are fabricated, if there can be a special tribunal which can expedite these cases to resolve this,\" she mentioned",

Escalation A journalist working for AFP on the northern edge of Gaza City reported he had been ordered to evacuate by the army, adding conditions had become increasingly difficult, with bombardments coming closer to his position and gunfire and explosions heard nearby. The UN estimates that nearly a million people currently live in the Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City and its surroundings. The territory's civil defence agency reported intense Israeli strikes in Gaza City's Sabra and Zeitoun districts, and an \"escalation\" in the Sheikh Radwan area north of the city centre. Abu Mohammed Kishko, a resident of the northern Zeitoun area, told AFP the bombardments the previous night had been \"insane\". \"It didn't stop for a second, and we didn't sleep all night,\" the 42-year-old said. \"We also couldn't breathe properly because of the smoke bombs -- we were suffocating,\" he added",

Critics of the war inside Israel have urged against pursuing the planned Gaza offensive, warning it could claim the lives of more soldiers and endanger the safety of hostages taken during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack. The Israeli army, whose troops have been conducting ground operations in Zeitoun for several days, said Saturday that two of its soldiers had been injured by an explosive device \"during combat in the northern Gaza Strip\". Hamas's October 2023 attack, which sparked the war in Gaza, resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Of the 251 hostages seized during the attack, 47 are still being held in Gaza, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 63,025 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the UN considers reliable",

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation gathering will be held in the northern port city on Sunday and Monday, days before a massive military parade in nearby Beijing to mark 80 years since the end of World War II. North Korea's Kim Jong Un will be among some 26 world leaders slated to attend the parade, though Modi was not on a list of attendees for the parade published by Chinese state media on Thursday. Modi's visit -- his first to China since 2018 -- comes straight after a trip to Japan, which pledged to invest $68 billion in India",

China and India, the world's two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020. A thaw began last October when Modi met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or \"dialogue partners\". Xi began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly, on Saturday. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also due to arrive in Tianjin ahead of the summit. China and Russia have used the SCO -- sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated NATO military alliance -- to deepen ties with Central Asian states",

Bilateral meetings Multiple bilateral meetings are expected to be held on the sidelines of the summit. The Kremlin said on Friday that Putin will discuss the Ukraine conflict with Erdogan on Monday. Turkey has hosted three rounds of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine this year that have failed to break the deadlock over how to end the conflict, triggered when Moscow launched its invasion of its pro-European neighbour in February 2022. Putin will also meet with his Iranian counterpart Pezeshkian to discuss Tehran's nuclear programme on Monday, a meeting that comes as Iran faces fresh Western pressure. Britain, France, and Germany, known as the E3, triggered a \"snapback\" mechanism on Thursday to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with commitments made in a 2015 deal over its nuclear programme",

Her comments came after Israel's military on Friday declared Gaza City \"a dangerous combat zone\", as it prepared to conquer the occupied Palestinian territory's largest city after almost two years of war. The Israeli military did not call for the population to evacuate immediately but the army's Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said on Wednesday that the city's evacuation was \"inevitable\". Israel is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its devastating offensive in Gaza, where the vast majority of the population has been displaced at least once and the United Nations has declared a famine. The UN estimates that nearly a million people currently live in Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City and its surroundings in the north of the territory. Any evacuation order \"would be imposed on civilians who are already traumatised by months of fighting and terrified by what could come next\", Spoljaric said",

From the mosque loudspeakers, usually reserved for the call to prayer, came a different message: boats were ready for anyone who wanted to leave. \"When you live here, you choose to live with the threat of war and the threat of floods. Where does one go?\" Zubaida said. Kasur lies just a few kilometres from the Indian border. From their rooftops and rescue boats, residents said they could see Indian checkposts across the horizon, a reminder of how closely their fate is tied to decisions made on the other side.

That agreement was suspended by India earlier this year, following the shooting of 26 people by militants that New Delhi said were backed by Islamabad, which Pakistan denies. That attack triggered brief but intense cross-border battles between the nuclear-armed neighbours, driving villagers like Shama from their homes. Then came the monsoon, and the rivers turned to flood. On narrow wooden boats, families balanced motorcycles, belongings, and bleating goats alongside their children, as rescue workers steered them through fields now turned into rivers. Rescue worker Muhammad Arsalan said many villagers hesitated to evacuate. \"People don't always want to leave because they're scared of thieves stealing what they're leaving behind. They're reluctant because they've done it so many times already,\" said Arsalan, who has ferried more than 1,500 people to safety by boat in recent days",

The Punjab provincial disaster management authority said flows in the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala This is close to the village we visited were the highest in decades, after a breach at an Indian barrage. At least 28 deaths have been reported so far, with water pushing further south through Punjab and threatening new areas. In India, cloud bursts in Ramban and Mahore regions of Jammu and Kashmir killed 10 people. Pakistani officials said the crisis was worsened by India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, halting the decades-old exchange of river data. Islamabad also accused India of releasing large volumes of water without adequate warning. \"If the treaty was in operation, we could have managed the impact better,\" Pakistan's Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters on Friday",

India has denied deliberately flooding Pakistan. It has blamed incessant monsoon rains and said it issued multiple flood alerts. Two gates of the Madhopur barrage on the Ravi River were damaged by surging water, Indian officials said. Farmers say the deluge has wrecked their livelihoods. \"Thirteen of my 15 acres (6 hectares) are gone,\" said Muhammad Amjad, a rice and vegetable grower. \"Women and children are mainly evacuated. Men stay behind to guard what's left.\" The back-to-back displacements have underscored the vulnerability of communities straddling Pakistan's volatile eastern border.
