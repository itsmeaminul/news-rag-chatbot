For instance, on 11 July, muggers fatally stabbed Mahfuzur Rahman, a college student and part-time worker, in front of the Tongi Roads and Highways office, as he was travelling from his rented house to his workplace. According to Police Headquarters statistics, between February and July this year, 34 cases of robbery and mugging were recorded in Gazipur city. In the previous six months, 26 cases were filed. However, many victims are not interested to file complaints due to fears of harassment and inconvenience. Experts believe this under-reporting prevents police statistics from reflecting the true extent of crime",

Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention",

A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid",

It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began.

The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north",

On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW.

On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21",

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said",

This summer, Liverpool are the top spenders in England, having forked out around €340 million (£295m) on transfers.

He fell to Carlos Alcaraz in the 2024 Roland Garros final and to Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open this year. \"I'm looking for the last step, right,\" Zverev said \"I'm looking to lift one of those above my head once. That's what I'm looking for.\" To that end, he turned to retired Spanish great Rafael Nadal and his uncle Toni Nadal in the wake of his Wimbledon disappointment, hoping to come up with some improvements that can help him challenge top-ranked Sinner and Alcaraz. \"It's about finding ways to beat the best players in the world, right?\" Zverev said",

According to reports, Isak had been promised an improved contract only for Newcastle to hold off due to pressures of meeting financial sustainability rules. Liverpool have reportedly had one bid of £110 million ($148 million) rejected, with the Magpies holding out for a British transfer record £150 million. The two clubs face off in the Premier League on Monday, but 25-year-old Isak will not be involved as he continues to train apart from the rest of the Newcastle squad. \"I think it is a lose-lose situation to a degree for us because I don't think we can come out of this winning in any situation,\" said Howe at his pre-match press conference",
