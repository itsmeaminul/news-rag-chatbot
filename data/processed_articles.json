Jobra village soon turned into a battlefield, with clashes spilling into narrow alleys. Many students were trapped and beaten there, some left bleeding from sharp weapon injuries, and rushed to the university medical centre one after another. By early afternoon Sunday, the Hathazari upazila administration imposed Section 144 (prohibitory orders) across the university area",

Whether they are at hospitals or clinics, all medical expenses are being borne by the university.” According to students, the unrest started when a female student from the Department of Philosophy, who rents a room in a building near gate no. 2 of the university, was assaulted by the building’s security guard around 12:15 am Saturday night. When she tried to enter the building, the guard allegedly stopped and assaulted her. Students stationed at gate no. 2 attempted to catch him, but he fled. As students chased after him, local residents began pelting bricks and stones, triggering a clash and repeated chases between the two sides. The student later told Prothom Alo, “When I returned home, I asked the guard to open the gate, but he refused. When I called out loudly, he started verbally abusing me. When I protested, he suddenly slapped me. As soon as my roommates came downstairs, he pushed me to the ground and started kicking me. My roommates and neighbours rushed to help",

Around 3:30 am, army personnel arrived at the scene, prompting both sides to retreat, though the situation remained tense. At least 70 people were injured that night alone, including 10 who suffered machete wounds. Following the late-night clashes, local residents blocked traffic from gate no. 2 through Jobra onto the Chattogram–Hathazari highway.",

The epicentre of the quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deep tremors. A series of aftershocks followed throughout the night, including a powerful and shallow 5.2-magnitude quake just after 4 am (23:30 GMT Sunday). Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. Nangarhar province was also hit by flooding overnight Friday to Saturday, which killed five people and destroyed crops and property, provincial authorities said. Last year a series of strong quakes jolted Afghanistan's Herat province, killing more than 1,500 people and damaging or destroying more than 63,000 homes, according to an assessment by the United Nations, the European Union and the Asian Development Bank",

Last year a series of strong quakes jolted Afghanistan's Herat province, killing more than 1,500 people and damaging or destroying more than 63,000 homes, according to an assessment by the United Nations, the European Union and the Asian Development Bank",

Students and teachers say that the culture of hall domination and torture is a major issue in this DUCSU and hall union elections. Those who have opposed it are likely to do well in the polls. For this reason, even student organisations tied to political parties have nominated relatively well-known leaders who have been vocal about student rights.

In 2019, the late writer and researcher Syed Abul Maksud wrote an article in Prothom Alo titled “How the student union was formed at Dhaka University.” In it, he explained that after the university opened on 1 July, 1921, the Muslim Hall Union was established on 23 September. Soon after, Dhaka Hall Union and Jagannath Hall Union were formed, and in the 1924–25 academic year, the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union was established.

The DUCSU VP (Vice President) and GS (General Secretary) were elected by the votes of these representatives. Each year, the VP and GS posts would rotate among different halls. In 1970, direct voting began, meaning that the VP, GS, and central student union leaders were elected directly by the students. In his book History of the Student Movement in Bangladesh (1830–1971), Mohammad Hannan describes DUCSU elections of that era. At the time, DU elections had unique practices. In hall union campaigns, organisation leaders would give speeches from different platforms in events known as “platform campaigns.” Typically, central union candidates spoke in Bangla, while most hall candidates spoke in English, displaying their knowledge of national and international politics, literature, and culture",

I hope the remaining steps will also be implemented with the cooperation of the government,” the Chief Justice said. He was speaking this evening as the chief guest at a discussion titled “July Uprising: Judicial Reforms” organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) at its auditorium. He stressed the need for completing the process of ensuring full institutional autonomy of the judiciary, enhancing transparency in its functions, maintaining discipline in the conduct of judicial officers, and extending the reform process to every court across the country. Refaat Ahmed said the judiciary is working relentlessly to restore its full independence and discipline, adding, “The judiciary must serve the people with fairness, courage and integrity",

He termed the activation of the Supreme Judicial Appointment Council a historic step, as it has introduced a collegium-based system that ensures transparency and participation in judicial recruitment.

Another goal of the plan modeled on President Donald Trump's stated vision of making it the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" is to transform Gaza -- land which the Palestinians want to be part of a future state -- into a tourism resort and high tech hub, said the Post, which viewed a 38-page prospectus outlining the initiative. It calls for at least temporary relocation of all of Gaza's population of two million, either through \"voluntary\" departures to another country or into restricted, secured zones inside the enclave during reconstruction, the newspaper said",

Bangladesh’s non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) continue to reel from the legacy of Prashanta Kumar (PK) Halder’s financial manoeuvring, which has left the sector mired in sustained crisis. Smaller institutions such as CVC, Midas, Meridian and National Finance each reported losses ranging between Tk 300-700 million (30–70 crore). Documents of the financial organisations reveal that, before and after the 2014 general elections, ownership of at least four NBFIs underwent abrupt and opaque changes, paving the way for PK Halder’s takeover",

What percentage of qualified candidates are typically found in a single BCS exam? Mobasser Monem: The number isn’t fixed; it varies. Generally, we recommend about 0.45 per cent to 0.65 per cent of candidates in a BCS exam. For example, the recommendation rate was 0.54 per cent in the 37th BCS, 0.64 per cent in the 38th, 0.48 per cent in the 40th, 0.62 per cent in the 41st, 0.49 per cent in the 43rd, and 0.48 per cent in the 44th BCS. Many engineers and physicians are now opting for administration, police, or foreign service cadres instead of the technical cadres designated for their professions.

Will the commission recommend more candidates from the non-cadre list? Mobasser Monem: The commission believes that the more candidates we can recruit from the non-cadre list into government service, the better. It saves both time and money, ensures talented individuals enter public service, and reduces corruption in recruitment. But for this to happen, inter-ministerial coordination is crucial. If we receive proper requisitions from the government, the PSC can indeed recommend a greater number of non-cadre candidates",

However, it is disappointing that the Public Administration Reform Commission made recommendations without consulting us. Their report had procedural flaws.

    "text": "A section of politically vested quarters have deliberately destabilised Bangladesh in pursuit of their own narrow interests, observed Professor Samina Luthfa of the Department of Sociology at Dhaka University. “The government has been utterly incapable of controlling this destabilisation. We have never witnessed such a dreadful state of law and order before. Each day we step outside risking our lives,” she said. She made these remarks at an anti-repression teachers’ rally held at the foot of the Aparajeyo Bangla sculpture on Dhaka University campus, organised by the University Teachers’ Network on Sunday afternoon. The rally was convened to protest the ongoing persecution, assaults and dismissals of teachers across the country, the arbitrary mass lawsuits, organised attacks on citizens’ rights movements, and the military–police torture of Nurul Haque, president of Gono Odhikar Parishad and former DUCSU vice-president",

Referring to the violence in July 2024, Professor Samina Luthfa said, “The demand had been for the killings of July to be investigated and brought to justice. But neither an inquiry nor any trial has been seen. As a result, people appeared to have lost faith in the justice system over the past year. To this is now added a sort of competition among certain political quarters, who are exploiting the gaps in law enforcement for their own special interests, leaving Bangladesh in disarray.” Calling last year’s uprising an “eruption of public anger,” she stated, “One year has passed. Now is the time for peace, for reconstruction. This situation can no longer be allowed to persist",

This situation can no longer be allowed to persist.” Citing the incident of harassment of Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman (Karzon) of Dhaka University at the Dhaka Reporters’ Unity (DRU) on 28 August, Professor Luthfa said, “A colleague goes to express his views, to attend a protest meeting, and is subjected to humiliation at the hands of various interest groups. Yet the university administration has not uttered a single word in his defence. This suggests that the present administration is scarcely different from the self-serving one of the past. Both remain preoccupied with advancing their own political agendas, even playing games to prove their loyalties. The question remains—who will safeguard the interests of teachers? Even a teachers’ association is ineffective at the university",

Speaking on the recent assault on Nurul Haque, Samina Luthfa said, “The brutal attack on Nurul Haque sparked a storm of condemnation across the country. After this, the government and the Home Minister in particular have no moral legitimacy to remain in office.” She also expressed her apprehensions about the forthcoming national election amid such fraught circumstances. Professor Samina Luthfa remarked, if this climate of uncertainty is to be dispelled, law and order must be improved without delay. The alarming cultivation of mob culture within universities must be brought to an end immediately",

Shafiqul Alam said, “An inclusive, free, and festive election will take place in the first half of February. The Chief Adviser has once again pledged this commitment to all political parties. He emphasised that there is no alternative to elections.

After the meeting, Jamaat’s Naib-e-Ameer, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher expressed concerns over the government’s capacity to manage a national election. “The interim administration has failed to curb extortion.

But there is no scope for postponement. The election must be held on the date already announced, and the Chief Adviser has agreed on February as the timeline.” Responding to journalists’ questions about Jamaat’s doubts over the credibility of the polls, Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam said: “We are working on this issue",

The party has called on the government to ensure the rehabilitation and safety of the families of the martyrs and the injured.The NCP also urged the government to help repatriate individuals still detained in the United Arab Emirates for participating in rallies supporting the July uprising.

Modi said an atmosphere of \"peace and stability\" has been created on their disputed Himalayan border, the site of a prolonged military standoff after deadly troop clashes in 2020, which froze most areas of cooperation between the nuclear-armed strategic rivals. He added that an agreement had been reached between both nations regarding border management, without giving details. The neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. \"We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,\" Xinhua reported Xi as saying. China-India ties could be \"stable and far-reaching\" if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added",

Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington. Direct flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are being resumed, Modi added, without providing a timeframe. China had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilisers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China opposes Washington's steep tariffs on India and will \"firmly stand with India,\" Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month. For decades, Washington painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi in the hope that it would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing",

Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from Central, South and Southeast Asia and the Middle East, in a show of Global South solidarity. The meeting comes days after Washington imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods in response to New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil, a move analysts say has pushed Modi and Xi to align against Western pressures. Modi said India and China pursued strategic autonomy, and their ties should not be seen through the lens of a third country, according to an Indian foreign ministry-readout of the meeting. Modi emphasised reducing India's trade deficit with China and expanding cooperation on regional and global issues, including terrorism and fair trade practices, the ministry added",

The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said",

The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter",

Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention.

A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters",

Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent",

Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday.

Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs",

The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1",

A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd)",

The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser",

The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues.

As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars",

During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together",

But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design.

The family lives on borrowed land at Khamar Mokimpur village of Milonpur union in Mithapukur upazila, where six Robidas and seven Santal families reside. While most families there own their homesteads, Pradip's shelter comprised only two ramshackle tin rooms. Once a roadside cobbler, Pradip had lost his ankle to illness six years ago. With villagers' help, he received a battery-run van, which he drove to earn a modest living. Despite adversity, he dreamed of educating his children. \"Despite being physically disabled, our father worked hard to educate us. He wanted us to achieve higher studies. But the mob destroyed that dream,\" said Palashi. Apon wiped his tears and said, \"I may have to give up school. I must take up father's trade of mending shoes.

On the night of August 9, Pradip was travelling with his relative Ruplal Robidas on a rickshaw van in Rangpur's Taraganj upazila. Ruplal, 45, was on his way home to begin planning his daughter's wedding, while Pradip, was driving the van. Around 9:30pm, in the Burtirhat area, a mob stopped them, accusing them of stealing the van. Despite their pleas and explanations, the crowd turned violent and beat them severely. Ruplal died at Taraganj Upazila Health Complex, while Pradip succumbed to his injuries early the next day at Rangpur Medical College Hospital.

In my view, the greatest asset of Bangladesh right now is the anti-discrimination spirit we achieved through the July mass uprising, and the public aspirations to see that spirit fulfilled,\" he said. Debapriya made the remarks this morning at a citizens' dialogue held in a hotel in Dhaka city. At the event, a new platform called \"Bangladesh Reform Watch\" was launched officially. The Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh has organised the event",

He further said, \"In the coming days, the biggest task will be to establish this anti-discrimination spirit in the state, society, and politics of Bangladesh.\" He, however, questioned why the government's reform process has not progressed. He said, \"In the committees and commissions formed by the government, there was not enough representation of marginalised groups, minorities, and disadvantaged people. And finally, we saw discussions held mostly with political figures, but ordinary people's participation was not ensured. As a result, the reform proposals prepared by these committees and commissions could not move forward.\" \"Did this happen due to a lack of ambition? A lack of competence? A lack of capacity? Or was there some larger conflict of interest hidden within it? This question is now in front of us,\" he asked",

With three of Pakistan's main rivers in flood, authorities in the Punjab have set up 511 relief camps, 351 medical sites, and 321 veterinary facilities, evacuating nearly 481,000 people and 405,000 animals so far. More than 15,000 police officers have been deployed as monsoon rains continue. Farmers and experts warn the cost of recovery will run into billions of rupees to rebuild homes and re-establish farms. Farmer and activist Aamer Hayat Bhandara said unless the recovery is supported, food insecurity will deepen. \"Farmers grow the food that sustains us all. If they are left alone in times of disaster, the whole nation will suffer,\" he said",

On the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Tianjin, Modi held Putin's hand as they walked towards Chinese President Xi.

The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States said on Friday it would not allow Abbas to travel to New York for the United Nations gathering of world leaders, where several US allies are set to recognise Palestine as a state.

Israel argues the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory. Its annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights decades ago have not won international recognition. Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the West Bank, territory, to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Police set up checkpoints across capital Jakarta on Monday, and a police spokesman told broadcaster Kompas TV that officers were also patrolling the city to \"protect\" citizens and give a sense of security. Police had deployed a convoy of armoured cars and motorbikes to parliament late Sunday, in a show of force as they attempt to warn off protesters. The crisis has forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China this week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II. His close ally Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin warned Sunday that military and police would take \"firm action\" against \"rioters and looters\", after the finance minister's house was pillaged. At least three people were killed after a fire Friday started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar",

The 22-year-old five-time Grand Slam champion was made to work hard in a hard-fought first set but eventually pulled away to win 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. \"I think my style of tennis suits pretty well the energy here in New York,\" said Alcaraz, who has yet to drop a set at the tournament. \"The energy is special playing the day session, playing the night session. It doesn't matter, people are always there. I love it and I think that's why I play my best tennis here,\" he added",

The win moves Alcaraz a step closer to a potential last four assignment with tennis icon Djokovic. Djokovic, 38, continues his latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title later Sunday in a night match against unseeded German Jan-Lennard Struff. Alcaraz will face Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday. Lehecka reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for only the second time after battling past veteran Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, winning 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. \"I'm a bit speechless because it's been a hell of a match,\" said Lehecka, who is poised to crack the top 20 after matching his quarter-final run at the 2023 Australian Open. \"Definitely an unbelievable week and a half for me. I've been playing well,\" he said. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Players arriving for their weekend match at the Jerrabomberra Regional Sports Complex, 20 minutes from Canberra, were told to shift to another field when the egg was found on the centre circle. The Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council confirmed that, following advice from local wildlife service Wildcare, the field could remain closed for up to 28 days while the egg incubates. Moving it is not an option, as plovers are a protected species and known for fiercely defending their nests by swooping at intruders. \"We must be proactive in protecting native species",

It was also a record for a Sounders game at Lumen Field, beating the 69,274 they drew for the 2019 MLS Cup final against Toronto. De Rosario put the Sounders in front in the 26th minute, heading in a cross from Roldan. De Rosario had electrified the largely green-clad crowd when he came close in the third minute with a header saved by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari. It was a frustrating first half for Inter in the face of Seattle's physical defense, with Obed Vargas a particular thorn in Messi's side.

He has been the subject of a protracted and acrimonious transfer saga this summer, training away from the rest of the Newcastle squad after making clear his desire to move to Liverpool. Newcastle reportedly rejected an initial £110 million bid for Isak earlier this summer. But the deal edged closer after the Magpies signed German international striker Nick Woltemade on Saturday for a club-record fee reported to be worth up to £69 million. Isak will become the latest blockbuster acquisition in a lavish summer spending spree by Liverpool, who also brought in German midfielder Florian Wirtz in another massive deal. The Reds have also signed French attacker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen and Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe had hinted for the first time on Friday he might be open to allowing Isak to leave because of the impact a sale would have on Newcastle's profit and sustainability calculations",

The northeast club were forced to sell Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh last year in order to avoid a points deduction, and a sizeable return on their investment in Isak would ease any Profit and Sustainability Regulations concerns. Despite the influx of new talent Liverpool have not so far looked like the relentless team that strolled to the Premier League title last season with four games to spare. But they still top the table with three wins from three after dispatching last year's runners-up, Arsenal, 1-0 at Anfield on Sunday. Newcastle sit 17th in the early running after a 0-0 stalemate against Leeds United. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The Athletic reported that Isak will undergo a medical on Monday before completing a six-year deal with the Merseyside club. Isak, 25, scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season -- behind only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah -- as Newcastle qualified for the Champions League. He has been the subject of a protracted and acrimonious transfer saga this summer, training away from the rest of the Newcastle squad after making clear his desire to move to Liverpool. Newcastle reportedly rejected an initial £110 million bid for Isak earlier this summer",

Flick shuffled his pack, bringing Dani Olmo and Andreas Christensen into the starting line-up among several changes, with Marcus Rashford dropping to the bench.

Barca took the lead in the 40th minute from the spot as 18-year-old Yamal sent Augusto Batalla the wrong way, although Rayo were unhappy with how the Spain international won the penalty. Yamal fell after a collision with Pep Chavarria in the area, which Rayo felt the teenage winger forced, and to make matters worse because of technical difficulties the referee could not communicate with his VAR colleagues over a potential review. Rayo coach Inigo Perez said he would not blame the referee but was upset with the \"inefficiency\". Dani Olmo should have doubled Barca's lead before half-time but fired over the bar after Batalla pushed the ball back into his path, with the goal gaping.

Ratiu turned home after Rayo kept the chance alive but it was disallowed for offside. \"We totally (could have won), we controlled the game,\" said Palazon. \"It didn't happen for us, we had so many chances... but we have to be happy with the work we put in today.\" Defensive struggles Barcelona left with a point, largely thanks to the superb work of goalkeeper Garcia, as despite Flick's changes they showed the same defensive deficiencies on show during last weekend's comeback win at Levante. \"We're working (on our high defensive line) but I don't think that's the reason we conceded -- the goal came from a set piece,\" added Yamal",

The 31-year-old enjoys spinning tracks as a DJ and has recently launched his own YouTube channel, where he shares travel vlogs, including experiences from the ongoing Bangladesh tour. On Sunday, however, Max added a new skill to his repertoire -- sports journalism. During teammate Noah Croes' maiden official press conference at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, ahead of the second T20I against Bangladesh, Max surprised everyone by arriving with a GoPro camera in hand and taking a seat among the journalists. Netherlands media manager Corey Rutgers had informed the press beforehand that Noah was feeling nervous ahead of his first appearance before the media",

Not only did he film the entire session, but Max also threw in a few cheeky questions for his teammate, asking about the story behind Noah's nickname, \"Tonker,\" and his favourite Bangladeshi cricketer. Noah, smiling at Max's effort, revealed that Mustafizur Rahman topped his list. \"It's a good one, Maxi,\" he said. \"There are a number of honourable mentions, but it's hard to go past Mustafizur. Facing him at the 2024 T20 World Cup was a really cool experience.\" As the conference went on, Noah appeared to overcome his initial nervousness. When asked how Max performed in his new role as a journalist, he quipped: \"I think he's got a career there. He's very good. The social media side, he's going to be there post-career for sure.\" Noah ended the session by expressing appreciation for the warm reception in Bangladesh: \"It's definitely something different. It's great to see how passionate people here are about cricket",

But Ballon d'Or holder Rodri, who had also started a Club World Cup match in the summer, was unable to inspire City to their second win of the season. Haaland should have given City an early lead after racing clean through, but he scuffed a tame shot straight at Bart Verbruggen. He also lashed just wide from 18 yards after a flowing City move. The Norway striker missed another chance with a weak header from Rayan Ait-Nouri's cross, allowing Verbruggen the chance to claw it to safety. Haaland persevered and finally pierced the Brighton defence in the 34th minute, stabbing past Verbruggen from close-range after Omar Marmoush prodded the ball into his path. Haaland forced Verbruggen into a miscued clearance just before half-time, but Rodri blazed the chance over. Matheus Nunes handed Brighton a lifeline in the 67th minute",

A tense tussle at Anfield looked set to end in a stalemate until the Hungarian's 83rd-minute strike ensured the defending champions remain the only side with a perfect record from the opening three games. In all three matches, Arne Slot's men have scored late winners, also overcoming Bournemouth and Newcastle in dramatic fashion. Liverpool may still be a work in progress after overhauling the squad that romped to the title last season. But they remain the team to beat thanks to an abundance of attacking talent capable of match-winning moments like the one Szoboszlai produced",

Liverpool could even be stronger come the end of the transfer window on Monday as they look to add Newcastle's unsettled striker Alexander Isak and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster thier defence. Arsenal have backed Mikel Arteta with over £250 million ($338 million) worth of new signings in a bid to usurp the Reds and win the Gunners' first Premier League title since 2004. The visitors were hampered by the absence of the injured Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz. But Viktor Gyokeres did little to silence doubts that he can make the step up from a prolific spell at Sporting Lisbon to the Premier League. The Swede was easily marshalled by Virgil van Dijk. To add to the Gunners injury woes, William Saliba went off inside the opening five minutes, replaced by Christhian Mosquera",

The Spanish under-21 international is yet to make a Premier League start but was not seriously tested as Liverpool's new-look attack struggled to click into gear. Despite defensive issues this season, Slot again named a front four of club record signing Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike. At Arsenal, Noni Madueke's arrival was not met with enthusiasm by fans who even started a petition to block the England international's £48.5 million move from Chelsea. Deputising for Saka on the right wing, Madueke was by fair the visitors biggest threat. Milos Kerkez has had a difficult start to his Liverpool career and was consistently beaten for pace by Madueke, who lacked the finishing touch.

The second half followed the same cagey pattern with both sides wary of risking a damaging early defeat in the title race. Liverpool did have the ball in the net on the hour only to be denied by the offside flag. David Raya breathed a sigh of relief after he failed to hold Wirtz's effort and then tripped Gakpo before Ekitike forced the ball in. Psychological blow However, Gakpo had strayed offside before collecting the rebound. That excitement did at least bring the Anfield crowd to life to inspire a late Liverpool push for all three points. Arsenal had not conceded this season and it took something special to break down Arteta's men. Szoboszlai's free-kick dipped and curled perfectly in off the Raya's right-hand post to leave the Spaniard helpless. Arsenal had a penalty shout waved away for Joe Gomez's challenge on Eberechi Eze in their pursuit of an equaliser",

Jackson flew to Munich on Saturday to seal his season-long switch to the Bundesliga champions, only to be told the move had to be aborted due to Chelsea's injury problems. Speaking after a 3-2 win at Augsburg on Saturday, Bayern sporting director Max Eberl confirmed that the deal was off. \"If we didn't have hope, we wouldn't still be here anymore!\" Meanwhile, Chelsea are reportedly exploring a move for Sporting Lisbon's Conrad Harder before Monday's transfer deadline, which could open the way for Jackson to join Bayern after all. Earlier on Saturday, a deal had been agreed that would have seen the Senegal striker move for an initial £13 million (15 million euros) loan fee with an option for Bayern to make the deal permanent for £52 million",
