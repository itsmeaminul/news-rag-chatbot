Tariffs of up to 50 per cent threaten Indian exporters and jobs. US President Donald Trump's doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50 per cent took effect as scheduled on Wednesday, delivering a serious blow to ties between two powerful democracies that had in recent decades become strategic partners. A punitive 25 per cent tariff, imposed due to India's purchases of Russian oil, was added to Trump's prior 25 per cent tariff on many imports from the South Asian nation. It takes total duties as high as 50 per cent for goods as varied as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals - among the highest imposed by the US and roughly on par with Brazil and China",

The engineering students’ demands are as follows: recruitment to the 9th-grade assistant engineer position should be done only through examination and with a minimum qualification of BSc engineering; in the 10th-grade position, where only diploma holders are allowed to apply, higher degree holders should also be eligible; and only those who complete a BSc engineering degree should have the right to write ‘engineer’ after their name.

Whenever and wherever it is needed, all kinds of work, indoor-outdoor or technical-mental aspects, will be part of the Bangla Tigers' year-round programme. \"Bangla Tigers is the name of the project. Through this camp, we will work with the cricketers who are in the national pool, all the year round,” Sohel said, explaining the mode of work. “They practice separately for T20, ODI or Test. Sometimes in large groups, sometimes in small groups and sometimes one-on-one. There will be efforts to ensure that they can prepare throughout the year and are always ready,\" he said",

Sohel drew the example of player like Shadman Islam, a Test opener who is not considered for other format. Since Bangladesh have been busy playing T20 and ODI cricket of late, Shadman faced a hardship to keep him fit. The national team will play Tests next November and until then Shadman would have no cricket. Mushfiqur Rahim has quit playing in two other formats except Tests. The same case is for the likes of Mominul Haque, Khaled Ahmed or Ebadot Hossain. Sohel said the Bangla Tigers camp will have all the answers. “Those players won’t have to worry now. Through the Bangla Tigers camp, they will be provided the practice facilities to keep them in cricket now,” Sohel said",

He would have to work on specific areas,” he said. “We are working on areas where improvement is needed, where skills need to be modified, adjustments are needed. Now we are doing it indoors.

Many mothers in the char areas of Rangpur are themselves adolescents, making the situation particularly distressing. Certain remote areas remain extremely difficult to access for healthcare delivery. Without addressing Rangpur, achieving national progress will remain unattainable. Furthermore, healthcare is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; coordinated action from multiple ministries is essential. Collective efforts, along with skilled personnel, infrastructure and dedicated budgetary allocation, must give special consideration to Rangpur.

Many mothers in the char areas of Rangpur are themselves adolescents, making the situation particularly distressing. Certain remote areas remain extremely difficult to access for healthcare delivery. Without addressing Rangpur, achieving national progress will remain unattainable. Furthermore, healthcare is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; coordinated action from multiple ministries is essential. Collective efforts, along with skilled personnel, infrastructure and dedicated budgetary allocation, must give special consideration to Rangpur",

At the Qadirabad dam on the Chenab River, authorities carried out a controlled explosion of an embankment on Wednesday as the water levels rose. \"To save the structure, we have breached the right marginal embankment so that the flow of the water reduces,\" said Mazhar Hussain, a spokesperson for Punjab's disaster management agency. The Kartarpur temple, which marks where the founder of the Sikh faith Guru Nanak is said to have died in 1539, was submerged by floodwater. Five boats were sent to the sprawling site to rescue around 100 stranded people. Pakistan authorities said neighbouring India had released water from upstream dams on its side of the border, further increasing the flow headed towards Pakistan",

Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible",

Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official",

Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process",

According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines",

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said",

He is trying to become the first man to repeat as US Open champion since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004-2008. It is the longest run without a successful men's title defence of any Grand Slam tournament in the Open era. Sinner will be hoping to join Lorenzo Musetti in the next round. The Italian 10th seed matched his best US Open run as he blew past Belgium's David Goffin. Russian 15th seed Andrey Rublev beat American wild card Tristan Boyer in four sets. He advances to a last-32 tie with Hong Kong's Coleman Wong",

But we keep letting trees fall. We put a few planters on balconies and call it sustainability. We cool our buildings with air conditioning instead of shade.\" Zaman's firm, Ehsan Uz Zaman and Associates, takes on all kinds of work — residential, public, and private.
