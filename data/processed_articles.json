The current boundaries were set by the fascist government to suit their own interests. We want a return to the pre-2008 boundaries. “In the current boundary, there is no balance in the number of voters. Our constituency has about 420,000 voters, Bijoynagar has 610,000, and the Sadar has 600,000. If Budhanti, Chandura, and Harashpur unions are joined with Sarail, then voter numbers will be more balanced,” she explained.

Reforms in financial governance, logistics, energy and technology-driven competitiveness are also essential,” he added. Highlighting economic concerns, Mahbubur Rahman pointed to external debt stress, declining FDI, global trade tensions, currency devaluation, energy shortages and post-July 2024 economic pressures. “The debate is not ‘if’ we graduate, but ‘how we graduate,” he said",

The LDC graduation process, overseen by the United Nations Committee for Development Policy (UN-CDP), allows eligible countries to move out of the LDC category after meeting income, human asset, and economic vulnerability benchmarks.

He claimed Jamaat-e-Islami was also not allowed to speak, besides BNP. Aminul Haque Chowdhury, NCP’s chief coordinator for Bijoynagar upazila in Brahmanbaria, told Prothom Alo, “Our demand is to keep Bijoynagar intact. Rumeen Farhana filed an application to carve out three unions. \"When we went to present our arguments, she and her thugs attacked us in front of the chief election commissioner and other commissioners.

Similarly, on his return via the Bhogra area flyover, Dhaka-bound traffic is stopped. On 14 August at 10:15 am, these correspondents started traveling from Gazipur toward Dhaka. At Tongi College Gate, police stopped vehicles at the flyover entrance. When asked why, two duty traffic officers, Rafiqul Islam and Shahidul Islam, said, “The Commissioner is arriving from Dhaka now, so vehicles cannot enter the flyover. Once ‘Sir’ reaches Gazipur, all lanes toward Dhaka will reopen.” This creates long lines in the Dhaka-bound lanes",

This causes severe congestion in the adjacent lanes.” An internal police report confirms this practice. It notes that when Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan travels from Dhaka to Gazipur, no vehicles are allowed on the Dhaka-bound flyover from 8:00 am to 11:00 am or 12:00 pm in noon. Similarly, when he returns to his Gulshan residence in the evening, Gazipur-bound lanes are closed, causing serious inconvenience for commuters, students, and office-goers",

Secretaries and advisers travel around Dhaka with protection, yet no disturbance occurs. I don’t have a residence there. I had requested a bungalow in Gazipur to move my family there. You should write a news report for a bungalow to be built.” Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan was appointed GMP Commissioner on 11 November last year. On 1 May this year, he became President of the Bangladesh Police Service Association. Multiple GMP officers told Prothom Alo that there is no government residence in Gazipur for the commissioner. Therefore, he commutes from his Gulshan residence",

Questions have arisen about the white Prado car the commissioner uses. It is unclear whether it is government-owned or private. No full registration number was visible. An internal police report states that when Muhammad Ibrahim Khan was deputy commissioner (traffic), he purchased a car for the current commissioner. It is a while car, with registration number “Dhaka-694 Sh.” Ibrahim Khan allegedly used funds obtained from seized vehicles for this. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, formerly of GMP under the previous Awami League government, was made OSD in the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Public Safety Division on 25 February",

Garment workers and others block roads and march, often paralysing the city. Students also stage demonstrations. During such times, senior police officers must be present for monitoring, decision-making, and coordination. Absence of the Commissioner makes it harder to manage the situation. Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan said regarding this issue, “There is industrial police for the industrial city.

Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official",

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said",

With recent funding cuts, humanitarian assistance has been reduced, threatening both refugees and host communities. He also urged accountability for Myanmar's military over genocide and crimes against humanity. Advocate Saki A Kawsar alleged Rohingya involvement in drug trafficking and human trafficking cases and called for a separate court to handle such matters. Noor Ahmad Anwari said the promised allocation of 25 percent of aid for host communities was not working effectively and urged a comprehensive employment policy for locals. \"Law and order has deteriorated.

In total, seven national records were set during the meet, with three coming on the final day alone. Interestingly, Rinky was once on track to become a footballer.

The ground will have to be raised further with new soil in both outer ground and the main stadium. Aminul attended a program titled 'Cricket development and Idea' organised by the Narayanganj district sports association and went to see the stadium as part of his trip to Narayanganj. \"Even now the interest in cricket from Narayanganj has made me very happy. Before coming here, I went to the Fatullah stadium. The stadium's miserable conditions brought tears to my eyes. There was a time the venue hosted many national and international matches but now it's in miserable condition,\" Aminul said during the program",

The BCB president has been checking out venues and infrastructures in divisions such as Chattogram, Khulna, Sylhet and others and said that in line with the idea of decentralizing cricket, Narayanganj needs development. \"Players need to have more opportunities and facilities. I saw three wickets here. Our play is to build at least 20 wickets here. In our time, there was a specific time when cricket was played but now matches take place in all twelve months. So aside from increasing benefits for our players, we will try to improve benefits for coaching as well,\" he said",

Four minutes after that, Prity doubled the lead with a strike from outside the area, punishing Nepal goalkeeper Laxmi Oli for rushing out to clear a long ball intended for Alpi Akter. Bangladesh, however, struggled to maintain momentum in the second half. Nepal created more chances, with Sahara Limbu striking the post in the 55th minute before failing to beat goalkeeper Yearzan Bagum in a one-on-one just minutes later. Prity came close again late in the match, hitting the near post twice, while Thuinuye also rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort",

I'm really, really disappointed for that.\" Son has wasted no time in making his presence felt. His first goal comes a week after he delivered an assist in LAFC's 2-0 win over New England Revolution. \"I need still a lot of time to be connecting with the team,\" said Son, who will play his first home game next weekend when LAFC host playoff-bound San Diego",

Morales, 38, duly doubled Levante's lead from 12 yards seven minutes into first-half added time. Stung by the decision, Barcelona came out roaring in the second half. Midfield metronome Pedri took matters into his own hand four minutes after the interval as he powered a 25-yard drive into the top corner to spark the comeback. \"They always tell me to shoot and look, in the first half I had a shot like a kid and in the second half I was able to score,\" the 22-year-old told Movistar. Flick's side were back level three minutes later when Torres made amends for his earlier miss with a close-range finish from a corner",

The 22-year-old, winner of the US Open in 2022, has already faced Sinner twice in Grand Slam finals this season, winning a five-set classic in the French Open in June before losing to the Italian in the Wimbledon final last month. \"Every time we face against each other on court, we raise the level to the top,\" Alcaraz said on Saturday as he prepared to face unseeded American Reilly Opelka in the first round on Monday. The men's draw will also see former world number one Novak Djokovic take another tilt at winning a record 25th Grand Slam. Djokovic, 38, has not played since reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon last month, where he was comprehensively beaten by Sinner",

Swiatek opens her campaign on Monday against Colombia's Emiliana Arango. Monday's first round games could also see a possible US Open farewell for Venus Williams. The 45-year-old tennis icon was given a wild card into the main draw after recently returning to tennis from a 16-month absence. \"Super thrilling to be back,\" Williams said on Saturday ahead of what will be a record-extending 25th US Open appearance",

Women's world number one Sabalenka opens the defense of her 2024 crown on the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center's Arthur Ashe Stadium showcourt against unseeded Swiss player Rebeka Masarova in one of the highlights of the opening day of the singles, which is being held on a Sunday for the first time in history. Both Sabalenka and Sinner are attempting to become the first players to successfully defend their titles for more than a decade. But I feel like I'm experienced enough to just focus on myself and try to replicate that result.\" Asked for her thoughts on the fact that the last 11 US Open titles have been split by 10 players, Sabalenka quipped: \"My thought is to change it.\" - 'Very difficult' - Sinner echoed Sabalenka's comments, attributing the difficulty of repeating in New York to a combination of factors -- season-ending fatigue, scheduling of games and size. But of course it's a very, very difficult tournament to play.\" Sinner and Sabalenka are the top seeds in a field that will be rewarded with a record $90 million purse, making the US Open the richest tournament in the world",

De Bruyne made sure Napoli would get off to a winning start to the new season in Reggio Emilia after Scott McTominay continued where he left off from last season with a bullet header in the 17th minute. McTominay was the star of Napoli's second Scudetto triumph in three years with 12 goals and again looked in fine form for Antonio Conte's team. The Scotland midfielder was unlucky not to double his tally for the evening on the stroke of half-time when his rasping first-time effort crashed onto the crossbar. Napoli have never retained a league title, not even when Diego Maradona strutted his stuff in southern Italy back in the 1980s, and their attempt to do so after the historic success of 2023 ended with a 10th-place finish",

De Bruyne's Belgium teammate could be out of action until the end of the year with a thigh muscle tear and his understudy Lorenzo Lucca struggled to get into the game on his Napoli debut. Sassuolo romped to the Serie B title last term but were outclassed on their return to the top flight, and finished the match with 10 men after debutant Ismael Kone was sent off in the 79th minute for two bookable offences",
