Earlier, the students brought out a procession from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) that paraded different intersections including Shaheed Minar, TSC, Doyel Chattar, Shikkha Bhaban, National Press Club, and High Court. As the procession of protesters were moving towards DMP headquarters, it was intercepted by police at Matsya Bhaban intersection. Barred, the students took position in the street",

Secondly, the three-point demand of demonstrating engineering students has to be implemented and a gazette has to be issued in this end soon.” On Wednesday, police attacked demonstrators who were pressing for their three-point demands while they were marching to Jamuna, the residence of the Chief Adviser",

Sohel drew the example of player like Shadman Islam, a Test opener who is not considered for other format. Since Bangladesh have been busy playing T20 and ODI cricket of late, Shadman faced a hardship to keep him fit. The national team will play Tests next November and until then Shadman would have no cricket. Mushfiqur Rahim has quit playing in two other formats except Tests. The same case is for the likes of Mominul Haque, Khaled Ahmed or Ebadot Hossain. Sohel said the Bangla Tigers camp will have all the answers. “Those players won’t have to worry now. Through the Bangla Tigers camp, they will be provided the practice facilities to keep them in cricket now,” Sohel said",

Bangladesh now have three different teams for three formats of cricket but when some players remain busy for a particularly format, the other players had to spend idle times. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) will provide all those facilities by running the Bangla Tigers camp throughout the year. Basically, this camp will include the cricketers in the national pool.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release, “No directive has been given by the government to the Bangladesh Army to take responsibility for these elections (DUCSU and hall unions), and there will be no scope for such involvement in the future.” Replying to a query on the army issue, chief returning officer Jasim Uddin said that army deployment has been considered in their planning. Returning officer Kazi Maruful Haque said that the proposal for army deployment arose from students’ demands for round-the-clock security",

China's foreign ministry, asked about the proposed new rule for Chinese journalists on Thursday, said it opposed \"the discriminatory practices adopted by the U.S. against specific countries\". The Trump administration said in the proposed regulation that the change was needed to better \"monitor and oversee\" the visa holders while they were in the United States. The public will have 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a proposal put forward in 2020 at the end of Trump's first term in office. NAFSA, a non-profit organization representing international educators at more than 4,300 institutions worldwide, opposed the 2020 proposal and called on the Trump administration to scrap it",

The latest move would create new hurdles for international students, exchange workers and foreign journalists who would have to apply to extend their stay in the US rather than maintain a more flexible legal status. The proposed regulation would create a fixed time period for F visas for international students, J visas that allow visitors on cultural exchange programs to work in the US, and I visas for members of the media. Those visas are currently available for the duration of the program or U.S.-based employment. There were about 1.6 million international students on F visas in the US in 2024, according to US government data",

We always go into every series trying to win and expecting to play good cricket, and if we play well enough, we absolutely have a chance,\" Edwards said in a press conference at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Thursday. That belief, Edwards explained, stems largely from the Netherlands' experience of high-pressure matches at recent ICC events. Notably, they stunned Bangladesh in the 2023 ODI World Cup, a result that the 29-year-old feels still adds to their confidence, even though the upcoming contest is in a different format. \"Anytime you win games against certain countries, it probably does boost that confidence,\" Edwards said",

Orlando will play in a third-place game, and the top three finishers in the tournament earn berths in the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup. In a high-energy first half, Croatia's Marco Pasalic silenced the crowd at Miami's Chase Stadium with a goal in first-half added time. Luis Muriel slipped a pass into the area and Maximiliano Falcon's attempt to clear it instead saw the ball deflect back to Pasalic, who rifled a left-footed shot into the net. Inter players appealed saying the ball hit Pasalic's arm but VAR confirmed the goal. Orlando, who had twice humbled their cross-state rivals this season, continued to stymie Inter in the second half",

In the second set I felt much better in the return game.\" Elsewhere Wednesday's Latvia's 25th seed Jelena Ostapenko was upset 7-5, 6-1 by Taylor Townsend before unleashing a furious on-court tirade at the American. Townsend said Ostapenko accused her of lacking \"class\" during her rant. \"She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US,\" Townsend said. \"It was unfortunate, but, you know, it's something I can put on my Tiktok.\" Ostapenko said on Instagram she had been angered by Townsend's failure to acknowledge a net cord in her favour during the match",

Tjen had become the first Indonesian player to reach the main draw of a Grand Slam in 21 years and followed that up with a first round upset of 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova. But she was beaten comfortably by Raducanu, who is aiming to recapture the US Open title she won as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021. Raducanu will face ninth seed Elena Rybakina in the next round",

The 22-year-old Spanish second seed unfurled a stream of 32 winners in a dominant display against the 65th-ranked Bellucci, whose best performance in a Grand Slam came with a run to the third round at Wimbledon earlier this year. \"I played great to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,\" said Alcaraz, who will face another Italian, 32nd seed Luciano Darderi, in the next round. Djokovic's victory sees him into the third round at the US Open for a record-equalling 19th time, where he will face Britain's Cameron Norrie, who defeated Argentina's Francisco Comesana 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), 7-6 (7/4). In the women's draw, meanwhile, defending champion and world number one Aryna Sabalenka moved into the next round with a workmanlike display to dispatch unseeded Russian Polina Kudermetova 7-6 (7/4), 6-2",

The BFF had previously demoted clubs such as Arambagh, Uttar Baridhara and Karwan Bazar Pragati Sangha for similar offences. The question now is whether it will act decisively against Fakirerpool -- whose management has changed since the political transition in August last year -- even if that reduces the number of BPL outfits this season. It has been an open secret within the football fraternity that a couple of clubs had been involved in gambling and match fixing last season, allegedly profiting in crores of taka. Yet the BFF only moved after FIFA's intervention, as it did in the past",

Bayern were two goals up and cruising not long after half-time thanks to a Kane penalty, his 31st successful spot-kick in a row for club and country, and Michael Olise's goal.

Bayern have not progressed past the German Cup quarter-finals since winning a record-extending 20th title in the 2019-20 competition.

BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official",

Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd).

It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process",

Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday.

He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments.
