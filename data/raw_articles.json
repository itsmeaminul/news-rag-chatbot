    "title": "Youth to reshape Bangladesh's political future: Touhid",
    "content": "Foreign Affairs Adviser Md. Touhid Hossain said on Friday Bangladesh's youth, who led last year's historic July-August uprising, will ultimately reshape national politics and institutions, moving the country beyond past divisions toward a more constructive, knowledge-driven future. \"They (youths) may make mistakes along the way, but with time and experience, they will build a stronger and fairer political culture,\" he said. The adviser was speaking as chief guest at the inaugural ceremony of the Bengal Delta Conference 2025, which convened policymakers, academics and experts to deliberate on the intersection of politics, economics and geopolitics in the South Asian region. Paying tribute to those who sacrificed their lives during the 2024 July-August movement, the Adviser said, \"Without their determination and courage, the transformation we are witnessing today would not have been possible.\" He expressed confidence that the new generation would not allow Bangladesh to regress to the political dysfunctions of the past. Highlighting the fast-changing global landscape, Touhid pointed to three defining events reshaping geopolitics: the Ukraine war, the genocide in Gaza, and rising US-China tensions. He noted that Western public opinion, especially in the United States, is shifting significantly in support of the Palestinian cause, with growing voices even within Jewish intellectual circles condemning Israeli actions in Gaza. On South Asia, he observed that US-India ties, once framed around containing China, appear to be undergoing recalibration. He cautioned, however, against assuming permanent shifts, saying that the \"geopolitical basics remain unchanged\" even amid talk of new alignments involving India, China and Russia. The Adviser underscored that the 21st century is certain to be an \"Asian century,\" followed by Africa's rise in the 22nd century if the continent can harness its demographic advantage and take control of its resources. Touhid Hossain warned that the protracted Rohingya crisis, now in its eighth year, is evolving from a national to a regional threat. He reminded that nearly a million young Rohingyas, many now in their late teens and early twenties, cannot be expected to remain confined to camps indefinitely. \"It is absolutely naive to think they will accept a hopeless life forever. If unresolved, the crisis will spill beyond Bangladesh and become a serious regional and possibly global security issue,\" he cautioned. Turning to domestic priorities, the Adviser placed strong emphasis on education reform, decrying what he described as \"educational apartheid.\" He lamented that while a small elite has access to world-class schooling, the majority of children, particularly in rural areas, are deprived of even basic quality education. \"About 30 per cent of students completing primary school cannot even read Bangla properly, let alone English,\" he said, warning that such disparities undermine national progress. He urged universities, especially Dhaka University, his alma mater, to become genuine research-based institutions rather than mass-enrollment centers. He stressed that the Dhaka University needs fewer students but higher quality outcomes in sciences, economics, and other critical fields. The Adviser concluded by stressing that politics must be treated not as an end in itself, but as a means to strengthen institutions, improve education, and create opportunities for youth so they are not forced to risk their lives migrating illegally. \"The political culture has to change. Parties may seek power, but power must be used to build institutions, expand knowledge, and secure a better future for our young people,\" he said. Former Malaysian Education Minister Prof Dr Maszlee bin Malik, former water resource minister of Nepal Dr Dipaik Gyawali, Dhaka university vice chancellor Professor Niaz Ahmed Khan, founder editor of the Wire Siddhart Varadarajan and the Daily Star Editor Mahfuz Anam spoke as the special guests while Economics professor of SOAS University of London Dr Mushtaq Khan delivered the introductory speech. The Bengal Delta Conference 2025, organized by Dacca Institution of Research and Analytics (DAIRA) has brought together regional and international experts to discuss the future of South Asia against the backdrop of climate change, shifting geopolitical alignments and economic challenges. The conference features sessions on governance, sustainable development and the role of youth in shaping inclusive politics.",

    "title": "Pakistan vs Afghanistan: Afghans have no specific targets: Captain Rashid",
    "content": "Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan says his team have no \"specific targets\" despite producing groundbreaking performances in recent ICC global events, ahead of a T20 international tri-series starting Friday. Rashid's men face Pakistan in the opening game in Sharjah, with the United Arab Emirates the other side taking part in the event which serves as a warm-up for next month's Asia Cup, also in the UAE. Afghanistan reached the semi-finals of last year's T20 World Cup in the United States and the Caribbean, and narrowly missed out on reaching the last four at the ODI Champions Trophy in Pakistan earlier in 2025. Those performances followed an impressive showing at the 2023 one-day World Cup, when the Afghans produced statement wins over England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \"We do not have specific targets, and we do not want to put extra pressure on our players,\" Rashid said Thursday when asked if Afghanistan are targeting the Asia Cup title. \"Our target is to play the brand of cricket we have played over the years. \"For us the main target is to put in 200 percent effort on the ground. \"I think we have been doing well in the ICC events and although we haven't played T20I cricket over the last few months, the guys have been playing in T20 leagues around the world and that has helped.\" Afghanistan beat Pakistan 2-1 in a T20I series at the same venue in 2023. The 16-man Afghan squad for the tri-series includes fast-rising mystery spinner AM Ghazanfar along with fellow spin bowlers Noor Ahmad, Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid. The Asia Cup gets under way on September 9, as teams ramp up their preparations for the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Contrary to Afghanistan, Pakistan's fortunes are dipping after they crashed out of the last T20 World Cup in the group stage before failing to win a match at the Champions Trophy. This year they lost a T20 series in Bangladesh 2-1 but overcame the West Indies by the same margin. Under new captain Salman Agha, Pakistan are going through a transition with former skippers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan out of the T20 squad. \"We are trying to build a team and this tri-series and then the Asia Cup will be a good opportunity to achieve that,\" said Agha. \"We know both these events will be challenging but we are ready.\" All three teams in the tri-series will play each other twice, with the top two to face off in a final on 7 September. Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan and the UAE, the Asia Cup will also include defending champions India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Oman and Hong Kong.",

    "title": "From hands to minds: Universities reimagining the apparel business landscape",
    "content": "Picture a ladder with three rungs. At the bottom is OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), making products to someone else’s design and shipping them under a foreign label. In the middle sits ODM (Original Design Manufacturer), designing and building products that others rebrand. At the top is OBM (Original Brand Manufacturer), doing it all—design, manufacture, and selling under its own name. Climbing from OEM to ODM to OBM means bigger margins and stronger brands. But for many manufacturers in developing countries, that ladder is missing a few rungs. We stitch the world’s clothes. But who stitches our future? That question haunts Bangladesh’s USD 47 billion apparel industry. Nearly 90 per cent of its garments ship under foreign brands, leaving local factories stuck with razor-thin margins of just 3–5 per cent, while overseas buyers pocket 4 to 5 times that in branding and retail markups. When COVID-19 hit and buyers walked away, USD 3 billion in orders vanished almost overnight—laying bare the fragility of a model built on dependence. Why is the OEM trap a big problem? Three reasons stand out-A) Value capture: Without own designs or brands, local firms forfeit the richest parts of the value chain—branding, distribution and margins. B) Vulnerability: Contract manufacturers are exposed to sudden order cancellations, shifting sourcing strategies, and price competition from lower-cost countries. C) Stunted capability-building: When firms focus on speed and cost, they under-invest in R&D, design teams, marketing and IP—skills that take years to develop. Not every country stays stuck. Taiwan’s semiconductor story proves it. Decades ago, the island was mostly assembling chips for others—a role not unlike OEM manufacturing. But Taiwan made a bold bet: government-backed R&D and deep collaboration between universities and industry. Institutions like ITRI worked hand in hand with academia to train talent, develop technology, and push beyond simple assembly. The result? Companies like TSMC emerged, not just making chips but designing them, owning the intellectual property, and leading the global market. Taiwan didn’t settle for chasing orders—it built an ecosystem of innovation. The leap from low-margin manufacturing to tech powerhouse didn’t happen overnight, but it happened because the country chose design, skills, and IP over dependence. So how can Bangladesh begin to break the trap? The answer rests largely on a pragmatic, scaled-up model of academia–industry partnerships—but not as one-off trainings or charity projects. It needs to be a systemic pipeline that turns classrooms and research labs into launchpads for commercial design and brand-building. Here’s how that plays out in practice- [a] Build skill pipelines, not just seminars. Universities need to move beyond theory and co-create curriculums with manufacturers—producing designers, technologists, and product managers who understand today’s supply chains. Quick workshops like chip design or fabric innovation bootcamps help, but they’re no substitute for semester-long project courses and mandatory internships that put students inside real factories and brand teams. [b] Turn labs into launchpads. Select university labs should become shared prototyping hubs—think fashion-tech labs, textile material centers, sustainable-dyeing facilities—where manufacturers co-fund pilot projects. These hubs must run on clear IP-sharing rules so the designs born there can actually hit the market, not gather dust in journals. [c] Lock up the ideas, not the progress. Small RMG manufacturers hesitate to invest in design because buyers control the IP—and the profits. The fix? Neutral IP escrow systems or shared-data trusts. These act like safes, holding design files under agreed rules and spelling out how revenue gets split when a product sells. It protects the innovators, builds trust, and keeps the ideas flowing instead of being swallowed by big buyers. [d] Recruit anchor buyers to run “co-branding” pilots: they provide market channels while local firms retain co-ownership of new designs—gradually shifting trust and revenue sharing. Universities can play a key role by facilitating design collaboration, structuring fair IP agreements, and embedding students in these projects for hands-on branding experience—critical steps toward building the capabilities needed for OBM leadership. [e] Build sectoral clusters (textile/garment design parks) where universities, incubators and small factories co-locate, supported by targeted tax credits for joint R&D and patient, concessional finance for design-to-market cycles. Here’s an idea worth testing: a National Design Accelerator. Picture a fast-track program pairing ten factories with university teams and a retail partner. It funds prototype development, provides legal and IP guidance, and guarantees a buyer trial if designs meet agreed benchmarks. Success is measured by prototypes hitting the market, IP registered, upgraded skills, and higher",

    "title": "Julia Roberts looks to 'stir it up' with cancel culture film at Venice",
    "content": "Julia Roberts hopes to \"stir it all up\" for viewers of her new film about a university professor grappling with fraught US campus politics, as the Hollywood star made her debut at the Venice Film Festival on Friday. The \"Pretty Woman\" star was attending the city's festival for the first time in her career for \"After the Hunt\", a cancel-culture psychological drama from Italian director Luca Guadagnino. Speaking at a press conference on Friday ahead of the premiere, Roberts said the film does not aim to answer questions, but provoke them. \"Everybody comes out with all these different feelings and emotions and points of views. You realise what you believe in strongly and what your convictions are, because we stir it all up for you,\" she told journalists. Roberts plays a Yale University professor haunted by a secret from her past after a student accuses one of her colleagues of sexual assault. Questions over truth and fiction, and whether characters are reliable narrators, course through the film by the director of \"Bones and All\". Touching on Gen Z culture and the generational divide between students and professors, the Amazon-produced film has overtones of Todd Field's 2022 drama \"Tar\", which handed Cate Blanchett a best actress award at Venice. \"Not everything is supposed to make you comfortable,\" Roberts's character in the film tells the student who claims she was assaulted. Roberts said the film did not advocate any one point of view. \"We are challenging people to have conversations and to be excited by that or to be infuriated by that, it's up to you,\" she said. \"We are kind of losing the art of conversation in humanity right now and if making this movie does anything, getting everybody to talk to each other is the most exciting thing I feel we could accomplish.\" Venice regular Guadagnino -- whose \"Call Me By Your Name\" from 2017 helped send Timothee Chalamet to stardom -- was in Venice's main competition last year with \"Queer,\" an adaptation of the William Burroughs novel of the same name starring Daniel Craig. Also Friday on the festival's third day was the return to Venice after 20 years for Park Chan-wook, South Korea's master of black comedy, with his new feature, \"No Other Choice\". It is one of 21 films in the main competition for Venice's top award, the Golden Lion. Howls of laughter filled the theatre at an early press screening for the thriller-comedy, in which a loyal paper company employee with a devoted family gets laid off and then decides to kill off any potential rivals for a new job. \"I've got it all,\" says protagonist Man-su (played by Lee Byung-hun) at the movie's start -- before everything goes terribly wrong. Three years ago, Park won a best director award at Cannes for \"Decision to Leave\", a critically acclaimed romantic thriller. The veteran director was last in Venice in 2005 with \"Lady Vengeance\", part of a trilogy exploring the dark recesses of the human experience. The two strongest early contenders for the Golden Lion include opening night feature \"La Grazia\" by Italy's Paolo Sorrentino about an Italian president grappling with indecision about euthanasia. Thursday brought the return of Oscar winner Emma Stone in Yorgos Lanthimos's darkly satirical \"Bugonia\", about two conspiracy-obsessed misfits who kidnap a pharmaceutical company CEO. Stone and Greek director Lanthimos, working together for a fifth production, are hoping to repeat their successful formula from 2023 when \"Poor Things\" nabbed Venice's top Golden Lion prize. Variety called Bugonia \"riveting\", saying Lanthimos was \"at the top of his visionary nihilistic game\", while Time magazine said Stone could \"do no wrong\". George Clooney's turn as an ageing Hollywood star struggling with his career choices in Netflix-produced \"Jay Kelly\" by Noah Baumbach drew less favourable reviews. The Guardian called it \"a dire, sentimental and self-indulgent film\". Another hotly awaited film, to be shown Sunday, is Olivier Assayas's \"The Wizard of the Kremlin\", in which British star Jude Law portrays Russian President Vladimir Putin during his ascent to power. A film about the war in Gaza, \"The Voice of Hind Rajab\", by Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, has attracted heavyweight Hollywood attention and will premiere next week. The festival -- which has become a crucial launching pad for major international productions that have gone on to Oscar success -- runs until 6 September.",

    "title": "They kicked me with boots and beat me: BUET student Rafid",
    "content": "A photograph of a police officer holding a student’s mouth shut has gone viral on social media. Prothom Alo has confirmed the identity of the student in the image as Rafid Zaman Khan, a third-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) student at the Sher-e-Bangla Hall of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Speaking to Prothom Alo over the phone late on Thursday night, Rafid said that a police officer grabbed him from behind, covered his mouth and pushed him to the ground. After reviewing video footage of the incident, he confirmed that the person who knocked him down was deputy commissioner (DC) Masud Alam. Rafid added, “After being thrown to the ground, I was treated in a very unprofessional manner. They kicked me with their boots, beat me, and at one point a police officer struck me on the head with a helmet.” On Wednesday, police fired sound grenades, tear gas shells and opened water cannons at protesting engineering students in front of the Hotel InterContinental, as they marched towards the chief adviser’s residence, Jamuna. The situation escalated into baton charges. During the clash, a photo showing Masud Alam, deputy commissioner (DC) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) in Ramna division pressing down on a student’s mouth spread widely on social media and was published by multiple news outlets. However, in a statement signed by Mohammad Talebur Rahman, deputy commissioner of DMP’s Media and Public Relations Division, the DMP claimed on Thursday that the image of DC Masud Alam holding a student’s mouth shut had been created using AI technology and did not depict reality. The claim was published on the ‘DMP News’ website as well. Fact-checking organisation ‘Rumour Scanner’, however, reported on its website that the photo showing DC Masud Alam holding a protester’s mouth shut was not AI-generated. They concluded that it was in fact a genuine image, which DMP circulated as AI-generated. Fact-checking organisation ‘Rumour Scanner’, however, reported on its website that the photo was not AI-generated. They concluded that it was in fact a genuine image, which DMP attempted to dismiss as AI-generated. Similarly, fact-checking platform ‘Dismislab’ published a report on their website today stating that the photo of the BUET student being restrained was not produced using AI. Confirming his identity Rafid told Prothom Alo, “The student in that photograph is me. There is no way this is AI-generated.” Describing the events, Rafid said that upon reaching Hotel InterContinental intersection on the day of the protest, he had decided not to advance further. He said, “We didn’t want any confrontation with the police. That’s why I sat down on the road so that police wouldn’t think we were in an attacking position.” He continued, “At one point, the police fired tear gas shells. One landed a short distance behind where I was. Soon after, they began firing sound grenades as well. When the tear gas shells burst, many of the protesters retreated while those at the front were trapped. That’s when police started charging baton.” Rafid added, “I was caught in that situation. I had become somewhat disoriented, and then I realised that I was being beaten continuously, mostly from behind.” Following the assault on engineering students, DMP Commissioner Sheikh Md Sajjat Ali approached protesting students at Shahbagh intersection on Wednesday night to apologise and assured them that a committee would be formed to take necessary action.",

    "title": "Latif Siddiqui says, no confidence in the court, what happened in the courtroom",
    "content": "At 9:30 in the morning today, Friday, expelled Awami League member and former minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Dhaka University law department professor Hafizur Rahman Karzon, and journalist Manzurul Alam Panna were brought in a prison van to the front of the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) court. The van then proceeded toward the lockup. An hour and a half later, they emerged from the lockup. Siddiqui wore a police helmet and a bulletproof vest, with both hands behind him, though he was not handcuffed. Behind him walked Dhaka University law department professor Hafizur Rahman, also wearing a bulletproof vest and police helmet. His right hand was handcuffed, and in his left hand he held the Constitution of Bangladesh. He lifted the constitution high with his left hand. Later, they were taken to the dock. A public lawyer approached Abdul Latif Siddiqui, who was standing in the dock, wanting his signature for a power of attorney. Siddiqui told the lawyer that he had no confidence in the court and, for that reason, would not appoint any lawyer. The lawyer then asked whether Siddiqui himself wished to make any statement in court. Siddiqui replied that he would not present any statement to the court either. At 10:35 am, Magistrate Sarah Farzana Haque of the CMM Court arrived in the courtroom. The investigating officer of the case, and Shahbagh police station’s sub-inspector (SI) Toufiq Hasan, requested that Siddiqui and 15 others be kept in custody. Toufiq Hasan said: “Your Honour, yesterday at around 11 am, while on duty, I learned that some people at Dhaka Reporters’ Unity were being surrounded and slogans were being chanted calling them Awami fascists. I saw one person standing and making a speech. That person was Abdul Latif Siddiqui. Upon questioning him, I learned that an organisation named 'Mancha 71' had been formed to prevent the erasure of the history of the Liberation War and to stop distortions of that history.” Police officer Toufiq Hasan said, “Your Honour, upon questioning those present, it was learned that Abdul Latif Siddiqui, by leveraging Manch-71, has in fact conspired to destabilise the country through an armed struggle and overthrow the current interim government.” At this stage, Additional Public Prosecutor (PP) Shamsuddoha Suman requested that Abdul Latif Siddiqui be kept in custody. He said, “Your Honour, the organisation named Manch-71 was formed on 5 August, the day the Sheikh Hasina government fell due to the mass uprising of students and citizens. The accused, including Abdul Latif Siddiqui, and the other accused are all beneficiaries of fascist Hasina. Over the past 17 years they have, in one way or another, received benefits from fascist Hasina.” PP Shamsuddoha added, “Your Honour, the intention of Abdul Latif Siddiqui is to bring fascist Hasina back into the country and are engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the current government.” Submitting the request to keep Siddiqui in custody, PP Shamsuddoha said, “In another case concerning a conspiracy to overthrow the interim government, several people, including a major’s wife, have already been arrested. Abdul Latif Siddiqui and others are also involved in this conspiracy. We will soon file a request to take them on remand. They will be questioned in custody to determine who are their accomplices and who else is involved in the conspiracy to overthrow the government.” While PP Shamsuddoha was presenting this statement, Dhaka University professor Hafizur Rahman, standing in the dock, requested permission from the court to speak. After being granted permission, Hafizur Rahman raised the Constitution with his left hand and said, “Your Honour, I am a professor in the Dhaka University law department. We are not being given the rights granted to a citizen under Article 33 of the Constitution. No reason has been given for my arrest. I have not been given an opportunity to consult with any lawyer.” Hafizur Rahman further said, “I am not involved in Awami League politics. I was invited as a discussant by the organisers of the Manch-71 event to speak on the Liberation War and the Constitution. Supreme Court lawyer ZI Khan Panna and Constitution drafter Dr. Kamal Hossain were also supposed to attend. Present there were Dhaka University professor Mesbah Kamal, former Dhaka University professor Syed Anwar Hossain, and former secretary Abu Alam Shahid Khan.” Referring to the case filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Hafizur Rahman said, “The case that has been filed against me is false. Yesterday, a group of terrorists attacked us, but instead of arresting them, the police arrested us and filed a false case. My reputation has been tarnished. The room where the police kept us had no fan. I could not sleep the whole night. I request to be granted bail…” Hafizur Rahman complained to the court that the statements made about them by the Public Prosecutor were false. He further alleged that instead of addressing the case itself, the PP was making",

    "title": "Why this conflict between diploma and graduate engineers?",
    "content": "Engineering students from across the country gathered at Shahbagh on Wednesday to press for a three-point demand. At the core of their demands is the abolition of the reserved quota in government jobs for diploma holders in engineering. They assert that engineering positions and titles should be reserved exclusively for graduate engineers. Considering the international context, there is little reason to disagree with these demands. The administration should have promptly engaged in dialogue with the protesters to establish order in the country’s engineering sector. Instead, the police attacked them, creating a bloody scene that further complicated the situation. Meanwhile, diploma engineers are also demonstrating. They want to be recognised as engineers and seek increased placement in appropriate engineering roles. Some of their other demands stem from conflicting interests, which graduate engineers oppose. An integrated teamwork between engineers and diploma engineers is essential for the industrialisation and development of the country. Engineering tasks should be handled by engineers, just as technical tasks within engineering should be handled by diploma engineers. The work of both groups complements each other. Therefore, instead of rivalry, there should be a fair distribution of responsibilities. Both parties should sit and resolve issues to work together for the advancement of the engineering sector. We must understand that the title ‘engineer’ is not an inherited designation. In developed countries, one cannot use the title solely based on academic qualifications. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree, one must pass a professional examination and meet a certain level of professional competence to be recognised as an engineer. Only those who meet specific experience, qualifications, and ethical standards—and who regularly renew their licences—are entitled to use the title 'engineer'. When they sign off on engineering work, approve designs, or conduct inspections, it can be assumed that they have done so while upholding the standards of professional responsibility and credibility. Engineers are required to follow a code of ethics, which includes a commitment to avoid corruption, bias, and negligence, and to maintain transparency. They are legally accountable for their work. If an engineer fails to fulfill their assigned duties, they risk losing their licence and the right to identify themselves as an engineer. The number of public and private universities in the country offering engineering degrees has increased. As a result, quality control in the engineering profession has become more important than ever. It is now essential for the government to introduce professional training, registration, and licensing for all professionals in the engineering sector, including engineers and diploma engineers. A valid licence should be made mandatory for employment as an engineer in all public and private institutions. Regardless of the level of academic qualification, no one should be allowed to use the title 'engineer' without a licence. Without an up-to-date licence, even diploma engineers—and, in practice, even bachelor's degree holders—should not be permitted to use the engineering title. Currently, the entry-level position for graduate engineers is at the 9th grade, while for diploma engineers it is at the 10th grade. During the previous autocratic regime, a policy was introduced allowing 33 per cent of 9th-grade positions to be filled through the promotion of diploma engineers. In practice, in some cases, even more positions have been allocated to diploma engineers. As a result, firstly, the opportunity for graduate engineers to enter the 9th grade has been significantly reduced. Secondly, diploma engineers are being promoted to positions that even graduate engineers cannot attain without passing the BCS (Bangladesh Civil Service) exam. This represents a major form of discrimination against graduate engineers and poses a serious concern for the engineering sector. The question arises: can diploma engineers be appointed to positions designated for graduate engineers? The answer is ‘no.’ Diploma engineers are not trained to work as professional engineers. Their field of work is different. Therefore, a separate parallel career track should be established immediately for diploma engineers in terms of recruitment, posting, and promotion. This will help clearly define the roles and responsibilities of both graduate and diploma engineers. Unnecessary rivalry between these two key professional groups in the engineering sector will be avoided. If both groups can work with clarity and confidence in their designated roles, the pace and efficiency of work will also improve. There is a severe management crisis in engineering organisations. In almost all cases, officials from the administrative cadre are appointed as the heads of these organisations. They are often unable to fairly address the professional issues of engin",

    "title": "Next election to be most risky, EC tells officials",
    "content": "Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin on Friday said they want 100 per cent neutral behaviour from the election officials in the upcoming national election, which is going to be the most risky one. “..this Commission's bottom line is professionalism and neutrality. You must send out this message,” he said pointing at the participants of an election training programme in the city. The CEC said this while inaugurating the two-day training for core trainers at the Electoral Training Institute (ETI) in Agargaon on the occasion of the 13th parliamentary election. Some 80 core trainers are participating in the two-day training programme, who will later provide training to TOTs (Trainers of Trainers) ahead of the upcoming national election to be held before next Ramadan in February 2026. Pointing at the election officials, the CEC said, “We want 100 per cent neutral behaviour.” The CEC asked them to be ready to face new challenges like to check abuse of social media, misinformation and disinformation alongside the law and order challenge in the upcoming election. Noting that the education of this training is morality, he asked the participants to uphold the morality always. Election Commission Abdur Rahmanel Masud stressed the need for performing the election duty by the officials following the constitution and the electoral laws. He said there is no scope to discharge election duty beyond the laws and the constitution. “Whether I can carry out the responsibility entrusted to me properly in line with the laws, which could be the only thing that should be the matter of our consideration,” he said pointing at the election officials. “There is no alternative to holding a fair election this time,” he added. Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker warned the election officials that the next general election would be the most risky compared to any election in the past. So, there is no alternative way or second option to overcome this challenge of holding a fair election, he said. “The slogan of the upcoming election can be, 'Presiding officers will be the nucleus of the election',” he said, adding that some 50,000 presiding officers will be required for the election, who should be inspired to play key roles for holding a fair election. “We must be firmly committed that we have to hold a good election,” he said. Election Commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Abdul Fazal Md Sanaullah said the Election Commission for the first time is going to ensure the voting rights of expatriate Bangladeshis in the upcoming national election. “We hope this time there will be a significant turnout of expatriate voters…A huge enthusiasm is being seen among them to exercise their voting rights,” he said. Election Commissioner Tahmida Ahmad said the 80 participants are the masters of 5,000-6,000 TOTs who will later train some 1,000,000 polling officers for the next election. EC senior secretary Akhtar Ahmed presided over the inaugural event, while ETI Director General SM Asaduzzaman delivered the welcome speech.",

    "title": "Why have the victims of the DRU attack been arrested?",
    "content": "Almost every day in the news there are reports of meetings and seminars being held at the Dhaka Reporters’ Unity (DRU) Segunbagicha, Dhaka. Organisers generally choose that venue in order to get media coverage. On Thursday (28 August) a newly formed organisation called 'Mancha 71' (Platform 71), arranged such a roundtable discussion titled “Our Great Liberation War and the Constitution of Bangladesh.” The event brought together several senior citizens of the country, including freedom fighters, university teachers and journalists. Video clips in the news and on social media clearly show that during the event, a group of people stormed in, physically assaulted the guests, and chanted various slogans. According to a report in Prothom Alo, these young men claimed to be “the warriors of July.” Other newspapers described them as activists belonging to different political parties. After the assault and humiliation, police arrived at the venue and detained 16 people, taking them to the Detective Branch office. Later, police officials told journalists that cases had been filed against them under the Anti-Terrorism Act. In response to a question from BBC Bangla about the reason for the arrests, Dhaka’s Detective Branch chief, Shafiqul Islam, said in essence that by analysing the detainees’ speeches, statements, books and columns, police had found information and evidence that was contradictory to the position of the state. I am not sure which books or columns our law enforcement personnel had the time to review in such a short span, and on that basis conclude that Professor Syed Anwar Hossain, Professor Mesbah Kamal, journalist Mahbub Kamal, former Member of Parliament Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Dhaka University teacher Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman Karzon, and journalist Manzurul Alam Panna were fuelling terrorism. But if that is indeed the case, then the state ought to unmask these teachers and journalists. It should present before the nation which books, which columns, and which talk shows they were involved in that constituted “anti-terrorism” activities. If it cannot do that, then the state’s actions will amount to persecution and a stance against freedom of expression. Naturally, the question arises as to whether these individuals were really involved in “anti-state” offences and if so, why didn’t the government arrest them earlier? Were they all fugitives? Had there been any cases or complaints filed against them? The state’s behaviour distresses us. Especially since, as the video clearly shows, a group of youths launched an attack, beating people, hurling obscenities and yet instead of arresting or detaining those unruly youths, the police arrested the victims who had been assaulted and humiliated by them. Twelve hours after being detained, they were even sent to prison. This incident at the DRU, of people being attacked by a mob, is not something entirely new. After being abused at the hands of a mob, people of various professions, even a former election commissioner, have faced similar ordeals. How much longer will be continue like this? It is as if speaking in favour of the liberation war or against the government means we are accomplices of Awami League. They are being called \"soft Awami Leaguers\". And yet this was the chance we have to retrieve the glory of our history and the liberation war, salvaging it from the hands of the political party that that made the liberation war their property, who has used the \"spirit of the liberation war\" to avail all sorts of advantages. Yet we see that one group of people fear speaking of the liberation war and giving slogans to this end. The other group is making most of the situation. There was a time when those who spoke against the authoritarian Sheikh Hasina government faced such lawsuits. The Digital Security Act or the Anti-Terrorism Act was used to suppress “political” opponents and send them to jail. Now, if the government born out of this mass uprising runs the country by following exactly the same footsteps as Sheikh Hasina, then what answer will it give to those who gave their blood to create the opportunity for change? During Sheikh Hasina’s rule, the intellectuals and civil society figures who had either emerged or been artificially manufactured under her government were busy singing her praises, foaming at the mouth as they endlessly invoked the liberation war and Bangabandhu. That circle was too afraid to speak against the government or against the ministers and MPs who had turned into monsters. After 5 August last year, these “opportunists” seemed to vanish into thin air, they could no longer be found in any newspaper columns or television talk shows. We saw a few voices raise themselves on issues of the liberation war, human rights, mobocracy, corruption, and injustice. A few courageous individuals continued to speak out for months, many of whom had been directly or indirectly involved in the student movement. But those arrested on 28 August all share o",

    "title": "Latif Siddiqui, Professor Hafizur among 16 sent to jail",
    "content": "The Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s (CMM) Court has ordered to send expelled member of the Awami League and former minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui, professor of law at Dhaka University Sheikh Hafizur Rahman (Karzon), and journalist Manzurul Alam, among 16 accused, to jail. They were produced before the CMM Court this morning, where Magistrate Sarah Farzana Haque gave the order. They have been sent to jail. More than 12 hours after their detention, a case was filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act against these 16 people around 12:45 am early on Friday. The case was lodged by Amirul Islam, a sub-inspector at Shahbagh Police Station in the capital. The other arrestees are: Abdullah Al Amin, Kazi ATM Anisur Rahman, Golam Mostafa, Mohammad Mohibul Islam, Md Jakir Hossain, Tousiful Bari Khan, Amir Hossain alias Suman, Nazmul Ahsan, Md Al-Amin, Syed Shahed Hasan, Shafiqul Islam Delwar, Dewan Md Ali, and Abdullahil Kaiyum. When contacted on Friday morning, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP)’s Ramna Division, Masud Alam told Prothom Alo that Latif Siddiqui and the others had been shown arrested in the case filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act. On Thursday morning, Latif Siddiqui, Sheikh Hafizur Rahman and others went to attend a roundtable at the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU). The discussion, titled “Our Great Liberation War and the Constitution of Bangladesh”, was organised by a platform called Mancha 71. Dr Kamal Hossain, one of the framers of Bangladesh’s constitution and emeritus president of Gano Forum, was scheduled to be the chief guest but was absent. Although the event was set to begin at 10:0 am, it eventually started around 11:00 am. Sheikh Hafizur Rahman was first to address the roundtable. “We are witnessing that an ill attempt is going on to throw away the country’s constitution. Jamaat (Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami), Shibir (Islami Chhatra Shibir) and National Citizen Party (NCP) are behind this. Led by Professor Muhammad Yunus, they have been humiliating freedom fighters with garlands of shoes,” he told the discussion. Immediately after the speech of Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, a group of people entered the DRU auditorium with a procession. They were chanting different slogans like “July-er hatiar, gorje uthuk arekbar”, “League dhor, jele bhor”, July-er joddhara, ek hou larai koro” and so on. At one point, they tore down the banner of the roundtable and confined the participants inside. Around 12:15 pm, a team of police from Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) arrived, and the protesters handed over at least 16 people, including former lawmaker Abdul Latif Siddique, Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, and journalist Manzurul Alam to the police. DMP Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Asaduzzaman was present at the scene. Shortly after 12:15 pm, police took several of the detainees, including Latif Siddiqui, away in a van. When asked why the roundtable participants were confined and handed over to police, a man named Al Amin Rasel said, “We are July Fighters. Here, fallen Awami League, Jubo League, and banned Chhatra League leaders and activists had gathered here to conspire. As long as the July Fighters are alive, we will never allow such activities.” The Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) issued a statement Thursday evening condemning and protesting the attack on the roundtable discussion and journalists.",

    "title": "Bangladesh heads towards its thirteenth election",
    "content": "It was the first week of May back in 1970. The Baishakh heat wave was full on. Dhaka University was heated too. DUCSU elections were imminent. At around 11:00 in the morning a group of students rushed through the corridors of the arts faculty building. It was a sudden procession and the processionists all wore read headbands. They called out slogans of the communist ilk, declaring a boycott of the election. They were activists of a particular ideology and were told by their guru that elections were a part of a reactionary system. There was no emancipation through elections, revolution was a must. Many people watched them, with hardly any reaction. It was only the animated activists who were drenched in sweat, gathering at TSC. You could get a Coca Cola for 6 annas then and that cooled them down. Some of them, bottles of Coke in hand, shouted out slogans against American imperialism. Meanwhile, another group of students marched by. They wore white caps, decrying coeducation and chanting Islamic slogans. That year the most festive DUCSU election in memory took place. Previously, the VP and GS were chosen through hall quotas. This time, the quota system was abolished. The election was held through direct voting. A few months later came the national election. There too, the presence of the boycotters was noticeable. The same mantra, the election is a trap of the bourgeoisie. There is no emancipation liberation through elections. Armed revolution is a must. This is what Chairman Mao Zedong has taught us. Many students frowned and asked, Mao Zedong? Who is he? Maulana Bhashani was a great leader. His party was the National Awami Party, NAP in short. He was preparing for the election. He had fought for many years for the demands of the peasants. He organised massive rallies with farmers. His electoral symbol was the sheaf of paddy. Many of his party members became candidates in the election. Their slogan was: \"A new day is here already, vote for the sheaf of paddy.\" The rival party’s symbol was the boat. Their slogan was: \"Joy Bangla.\" Then suddenly something happened with the Maulana! He announced that he would not contest in the election. At Paltan Maidan, he declared: “Independent East Pakistan.” Speculations ran abound. Why did the Maulana say that? One group was saying, things don't look good on the ground. The tide is in favour of the \"boat\" and the \"sheaf of paddy\" will drown. It will be humiliating and so it’s better to withdraw. Another group was saying, the Maulana was clearing the field for his disciple, Sheikh Mujibur. He didn’t want to waste votes.Arshad Sami Khan was ADC to Pakistan’s President Yahya Khan. People don’t know him and one will now have to say, he is popular singer Adnan Sami’s father. By then, Pakistan had already broken apart. Bangladesh had become independent. Long afterward, Arshad Sami wrote a book. In it, he spilled the secret that Yahya had given money to the Maulana for holding elections. Later it came to light that the Maulana himself knew nothing about the money. Yahya had indeed paid, but it was said that Mashiur Rahman, the Maulana’s party secretary, had pocketed it. Be that as it may, the revolution never happened. The elections took place with great fanfare. On the country’s horizon a new sun arose, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The country never turned into Naxalite land, nor did it follow the path of Makkah and Madinah. After that, many things happened. Struggles were fought. People killed and died. East Pakistan became Bangladesh. The country had become independent, but how would it run? At one time the British would rule this country and many people did not want this. They wanted home rule, self-rule, independence. The British rulers said, you are not qualified to be independent yet. When the time comes, we will grant you independence. Then the country became independent. The Gujaratis ruled, the Punjabis ruled, the Pathans ruled. There was the all-powerful Ayub Khan who said Allah had sent him down as a saviour for the suffering people. It was a tough task because Bengalis were not patriotic, they only talked about being Bengali. Ayub Khan had studied in English. His college had been in a small town called Sandhurst, about 32 miles from the city of London. He saw that the British were truly a race of rulers. They taught him that unless you whip them into shape, the subjects cannot be kept under control. Nirad Chandra Choudhuri was one of Ayub Khan's favourite writers. Choudhuri could not bear the air and climate of the country. He lived in Oxford. He was very irritated with the Bengalis. In an essay he wrote that Bengalis cannot take care of themselves. They are petty-minded people, always quarrelling among themselves. Ayub Khan was deeply worried about the Bengalis. Out of seventy million, only two men, in his eyes, had patriotism—Jabbar Khan and Monayem Khan. Can a country run like that? Then, all of a sudden, the country became independent. But no one seemed to care how it",

    "title": "EC aims to complete preparations by November",
    "content": "The Election Commission (EC) plans to complete all key preparatory tasks by 30 November, ahead of announcing the schedule for the 13th National Parliamentary Election. The constitutional body unveiled its work plan yesterday, Thursday, outlining the roadmap for the upcoming polls. The plan specifies tentative timelines for completing major preparations, including dialogues among stakeholders, finalising the voter list, revising electoral laws and regulations, registering new political parties, and demarcating constituencies—altogether 24 key tasks. BNP has welcomed the announcement of the election roadmap. However, National Citizens’ Party (NCP) said moving toward elections without first ensuring the legal and constitutional foundation of the July Charter amounts to reneging on earlier government commitments. Jamaat-e-Islami described the roadmap as conventional and somewhat misleading. The interim government and EC had earlier indicated that the 13th parliamentary election would be held before Ramadan (in the first half of February 2026). With that goal in mind, the EC formally announced its work plan. However, the roadmap does not mention the exact date of the election schedule. At a press conference held at the EC building in Agargaon yesterday afternoon, Senior Secretary of the EC Secretariat Akhtar Ahmed announced the plan. In response to questions about the election schedule and polling date, he said the schedule would be announced 60 days before polling. He added that the Chief Adviser’s Office has instructed the EC to organise the election before Ramadan, which begins on 17 or 18 February. When asked about demands for a Constituent Assembly and referendum, the secretary said the Chief Adviser’s directive is limited to the national election. “It is not within my jurisdiction to speak beyond the parliamentary polls,” he noted. Among the 24 preparatory activities listed in the roadmap are: stakeholder dialogues; updating the voter list; revising electoral laws and regulations; registering new political parties; delimiting constituencies; updating guidelines for observer and journalist; setting up polling centres; coordinating with law enforcement; and introducing postal voting. According to the EC’s work plan, reforms to laws and regulations, registration of new political parties, and finalisation of constituency boundaries are to be completed by 30 September. The draft of constituency delimitation has already been published, with the final gazette to be issued by 15 September and the GIS maps by 30 September. The draft list of polling stations will be published by 10 September. By law, the final gazette on polling stations must be published at least 25 days before the election date. Work on the voter list is already well advanced. A supplementary draft list has been published to include previously excluded voters. Those born on or before 1 January 2007 will be included in the list to be published on 30 August. The final voter list, incorporating those born on or before 31 October 2007, will be published on 30 November. The EC will begin dialogues between various stakeholders in the last week of September, continuing for about a month and a half. The dialogues will include registered political parties, university teachers, civil society representatives, women’s groups, media editors, election observers, experts, and July Movement leaders. The specific agenda has not been disclosed. Responding to a question, the EC secretary said that if new issues arise during consultations, the commission will incorporate them. However, he noted that after discussions within the Election System Reform Commission and the National Consensus Commission, he does not expect major changes. The EC plans to enable expatriates to exercise their voting rights in the upcoming election through IT-supported postal voting. The roadmap states that a mobile application for this system will be developed by 30 September and tested in October. Registration of expatriate voters is scheduled to begin on 11 November and continue until 30 November. Ballot papers are expected to be sent to expatriates between 20 November and 5 January. The EC had earlier clarified that these ballots will not contain candidate names, only the symbols of registered parties and independent candidates. Expatriates will be able to vote after symbols are allocated. The plan is to collect the ballots and votes back at least one week before election day. When asked if the EC sees any challenges, the secretary replied, everything is a challenge. The EC has the mental strength required to face every challenge. On questions about law and order before the election, he said that is the responsibility of the Home Ministry, while the EC’s role is to carry forward election-related activities in coordination with them. The roadmap states that after the schedule is announced, the EC will send letters to Bangladesh Betar and BTV to allow political parties to broadcast campaign",

    "content": "Zimbabwe have suffered a major setback as skipper Craig Ervine was ruled out of the ODI series against Sri Lanka on the eve of the opening match at Harare Sports Club, due to a calf injury. ICC said this in a new release published on its website on Friday. A MRI scan on Thursday confirmed that the 40-year-old sustained a Grade II strain in his left calf, along with a chronic and resolving Grade I strain in his right calf, ruling him out of entire series. In Ervine’s absence, veteran all-rounder Sean Williams will captain Zimbabwe in the two-match ODI series against Sri Lanka. The contest marks Zimbabwe’s return to ODI cricket following their recent home assignments, where they hosted South Africa and New Zealand for two Test matches each, along with a T20I tri-series. This is also the comeback series for experienced batter Brendon Taylor, who returns to international cricket after nearly four years, having last represented Zimbabwe in September 2021 against Ireland. The first ODI is scheduled today, 29 August, followed by the second ODI on 31August. The two sides will then shift focus to a three-match T20I series.",

    "title": "Ban vs Ned: Tigers look to win against Dutch in T20 series",
    "content": "Bangladesh are upbeat to make a winning start as the three-match T20 International series against the Netherlands starts tomorrow, Saturday at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. The match begins at 6:00 pm and will be aired live on T Sports Channel. The tour marks the Netherlands' first visit to Bangladesh for a bilateral series in any format of cricket. The series is considered Bangladesh's preparation platform for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Bangladesh, however, are expected to win the series with ease given the gulf of difference between the two sides in terms of strength and cricket culture. The Tigers haven't lost any game against the Netherlands in this format since 2012. In fact, they have lost just one match in five meetings between the two sides, and that too came in 2012 when Bangladesh toured the Netherlands for their only bilateral series. The two-match series was drawn 1-1. The Dutch last played against Bangladesh during the 2024 T20 World Cup, with the Tigers winning the game by 25 runs. But Bangladesh tasted a shocking defeat to the Netherlands during the ICC ODI World Cup in 2023 in India. Despite their good track record against the Netherlands, Bangladesh captain Liton Das refused to take anything for granted, saying that they are looking to bring up their best cricket in the upcoming series. \"An international match is always challenging. There is no big or small team here,\" Liton said ahead of the match. \"If we get a chance to check a few players, we will do that, but at the same time, we'll play to win,\" he added, hinting at some experiments in the series, keeping the Asia Cup in mind. Bangladesh have been training in Sylhet for the last 10 days. The practice camp was moved to Sylhet from Dhaka mainly to keep the run-fest nature of UAE wickets in mind. Liton also believes that the preparation in Sylhet will be useful to adapt to UAE wickets. \"When we play in the Asia Cup, we'll get different teams. We will not be able to bring the teams who will play the Asia Cup here.\" \"But I think the conditions will be similar. Because we all know, UAE produces good batting wickets. Sylhet is also a batting-friendly wicket to a large extent.\" A series victory against the Netherlands is expected, but a defeat will draw flak. Liton remains pragmatic about any kind of result. \"As I said earlier, in international cricket there is no small team. Bangladesh have lost to different teams before - nothing new. If we lose, we lose. What matters is how well we play.\" Netherlands captain Scott Edwards admits that Bangladesh are very strong on their home ground, but he believes his side is capable of winning the series. \"Yeah, absolutely (we believe we can win the series). I think you always go into every series trying to win. We expect to play good cricket, and if we play well enough, absolutely, we've got a chance.\" \"It's a great warm-up for us heading into the World Cup and also for Bangladesh before the Asia Cup. So, it'll be an exciting series,\" he noted. \"Bangladesh are very strong in their own backyard. Many countries come here and struggle. We know it's going to be tough and we have to put our best foot forward.\" The next two matches are on 1 and 3 September.

    "content": "BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has warned that a conspiracy is underway in Bangladesh to replace centrist and liberal politics, along with democratic values, with extremist politics. He said such a shift would be “extremely harmful” for the country. He made these remarks as the chief guest at the launch of Roktakto July (Bloody July), a book written by Syeda Fatema Salam. The event was held today, Friday, at the Abdus Salam Hall of the National Press Club in Dhaka. Speaking at the event, Mirza Fakhrul said, “There is a conspiracy to push aside centrist politics, liberal politics, and liberal democracy, and to bring back extremist politics. This will be extremely damaging for Bangladesh. That is why we must all work together to establish liberal democracy.” On the upcoming elections, he added, “I always say, the election will be held—and it will be held within the timeframe that has already been announced. Because there is no alternative. If the election is blocked, the nation will suffer immensely, and the possibility of fascism returning will grow significantly.” Referring to the roadmap announced by the Election Commission (EC) yesterday, Mirza Fakhrul said, “If political parties, institutions, and the government can move this forward together, we will be able to achieve our goal.” He added, “Sometimes I get frustrated when I see that because of a few miscreants, our long struggle, our fight, and our dreams seem to be fading away.” Mirza Fakhrul also claimed that every reform in Bangladesh has taken place under BNP’s leadership. “Some say we do not want reforms. Propaganda is being spread against us as if we oppose reform. But it was BNP that first called for reform. Whatever reforms have happened in Bangladesh have come through BNP,” he said. He accused several political parties of spreading false and misleading propaganda in an attempt to undermine the BNP. Calling on party leaders and activists not to engage in actions that tarnish the party’s reputation, he said, “You are not in power yet. There are many conspiracies and plots. You must counter these with good work, unity, and by reaching out to the people.” He further said, “The truth is, students first came out in July–August. But later, ordinary people joined them, and that is why fascism was forced to flee.” According to him, the people of Bangladesh now want change, and they want that change through the BNP. “The people are looking to BNP to see how it can fully establish democracy,” he said. The event was presided over by poet, journalist, and BNP Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Abdul Hai Sikder. Mahdi Amin, adviser to BNP’s acting chairman Tarique Rahman, was the keynote speaker. Other speakers included BNP Chairperson’s adviser Abdus Salam and Doctors’ Association of Bangladesh (DAB) president Professor Jahanara Laizu, among others.",

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly involved shoul",

The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280.

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

The 2022 Wimbledon champion, who had beaten Raducanu in their only previous meeting in 2022, struck early in both sets and never lost her focus as she sealed victory in 62 minutes. \"Yeah I'm really happy with the performance. It's always not easy to play against Emma,\" said the 26-year-old Rybakina. \"The score doesn't show it but she's a tough competitor. I'm pretty happy with the way I'm playing and I'm looking forward to the next match.\" Rybakina wasted no time imposing herself, breaking serve in the opening game with a number of clean returns before consolidating behind her own powerful delivery. She raced to a 3-0 lead, her ball-striking consistently pushing Raducanu onto the back foot. The Briton, who had swept through her first two rounds without dropping serve, was repeatedly undone by errors and found no answers as Rybakina closed out the set. The second set followed a similar script. Raducanu's first service game slipped away with another flurry of mistakes, and Rybakina capitalised with a straightforward hold to consolidate. The Kazakh landed just 47% of her first serves, yet Raducanu was unable to make any inroads against the second delivery. The 22-year-old briefly lifted the crowd by saving two break points, greeted by a loud cheer of encouragement. But the reprieve was short-lived as Rybakina dragged her across the baseline before finishing the rally with a forehand winner out of reach, breaking again as Raducanu vented her frustration by swiping her racquet. Rybakina then inched closer with an ace and sealed victory on the next point as Raducanu sent another shot long. The defeat ended Raducanu's most encouraging campaign at Flushing Meadows since she unexpectedly lifted the title in New York four years ago as a qualifier. Rybakina will next face either 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova or Italian seventh seed Jasmine Paolini. \"It's true, in the (past few) years it's not been easy at the U.S. Open and I was not successful,\" Rybakina added. \"I hope this year it will change.

Zimbabwe were well set with Sikandar Raza, on 92, on strike, as they needed 10 runs off the final six balls with five wickets in hand. But left-arm seamer Madushanka emerged as the hero for Sri Lanka, bowling Raza off the first ball of the final over, then dismissing Brad Evans and Richard Ngarava from his next two deliveries. Raza had his middle stump uprooted attempting a sweep, Evans was caught at short fine leg by Asitha Fernando and Ngarava was also clean bowled. \"I am just so happy to do this on my comeback. Very happy that we executed our collective plans at the death,\" said Madushanka, who held his nerve with the last three balls to close out the win. Zimbabwe won the toss and Sri Lanka posted 298-6 batting first courtesy of a late barrage of boundaries. The second ODI is on Sunday at the same venue. Sri Lanka recovered from losing opener Nishan Madushka for a duck as Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis (38) put on 100 runs for the second wicket. Nissanka top scored with 76 and, further down the order, Janith Liyanage struck an unbeaten 70 off just 47 balls. Kamindu Mendis also provided some late-order impetus with a 36-ball 57 before being bowled by Ngarava from the final ball of the innings. Left-arm quick Ngarava (2-34) was the lone Zimbabwe bowler to take more than one wicket at Harare Sports Club. The home team's reply began disastrously with Brian Bennett and Brendan Taylor both falling to Fernando in the first over, leaving Zimbabwe 0-2 after just four balls. Taylor was making his first ODI appearance since 2021 after bans for breaching anti-corruption rules and for failing a drugs test. But half-centuries from Ben Curran (70) and Sean Williams (57) dragged Zimbabwe back into contention before they slipped to 161-5. But Raza combined with Tony Munyonga in a brilliant 128-run stand to take the Africans to the brink of victory. Raza's 92 came off 87 balls and included eight fours. When he was dismissed by Madushanka, Munyonga was left stranded at the non-striker's end until the penultimate ball and finished 43 not out. Sri Lanka are touring Zimbabwe for the first time since 2008. Brief scores Sri Lanka 298-6 in 50 overs (P. Nissanka 76, J. Liyanage 70 not out, Kamindu Mendis 57; R. Ngarava 2-34) v Zimbabwe 291-8 in 50 overs (S. Raza 92, B. Curran 70, S. Williams 57, T. Munyonga 43 not out; D. Madushanka 4-62, A. Fernando 3-50) Sri Lanka won by seven runs Toss: Zimbabwe রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

    "title": "Alexander-Arnold dropped by England for World Cup qualifiers",
    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon Trent Alexander-Arnold was dropped by England as coach Thomas Tuchel on Friday handed first call-ups to Elliot Anderson and Djed Spence for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia. Alexander-Arnold was part of England's most recent squad at the end of last season, but Tuchel opted to leave him out of the September matches. The right-back quit Premier League champions Liverpool to join Spanish side Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer. However, Alexander-Arnold was left out of Madrid's starting team for last weekend's win against Real Oviedo in favour of Dani Carvajal. Speaking about his decision to axe Alexander-Arnold and leave out Everton winger Jack Grealish, Tuchel said: \"First of all, we decided on a bit more competitive squad. \"There is no doubt that I'm a big fan of Trent and Jack because of their talent and their personalities. \"They are big players. They will always be big players, and they will always be in the mix to be called up. \"I know that both of them are desperate to come back, which is really important. \"So competition is up, then they will stay in the mix. I know how desperate they are to come back but they can maybe have a bit more rhythm.\" Tuchel has named a 24-man squad for the qualifiers, with Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson involved with the senior side for the first time. Anderson starred in England's Under-21 Euros triumph over the summer, while uncapped Tottenham full-back Spence fills the gap left by Alexander-Arnold's absence. \"Elliot Anderson, very physical, a lot of volume, very precise clean passing, it is a good package,\" Tuchel said. \"A regular player for Nottingham Forest and had a fantastic season. He is excited to come join us and hope he can make his mark.\" Marcus Rashford, now on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United, returns after missing June's fixtures through injury. Adam Wharton is included in Tuchel's squad for the first time, but there is no place for Kyle Walker, Phil Foden and Ivan Toney. Harry Maguire was also overlooked by Tuchel, while injury has ruled out Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and Levi Colwill. Fit-again John Stones is included for the first time since Tuchel took charge, although he spent time with the group in Spain during a June camp as he continued his rehabilitation from a thigh injury. Brentford midfielder Jordan Henderson, 35, is again included after featuring in three of Tuchel's games in charge. The Three Lions host Andorra on September 6 before the Group K leaders head to Belgrade to face Serbia on September 9. England squad for World Cup qualifiers: Goalkeepers: Jordan Pickford (Everton), James Trafford (Manchester City), Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace) Defenders: Reece James (Chelsea), Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace), John Stones (Manchester City), Dan Burn (Newcastle), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal), Tino Livramento (Newcastle), Djed Spence (Tottenham) Midfielders: Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest), Jordan Henderson (Brentford), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa), Declan Rice (Arsenal) Forwards: Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Eberechi Eze (Arsenal), Jarrod Bowen (West Ham), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Noni Madueke (Arsenal), Marcus Rashford (Barcelona), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa) রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",

The 21-year-old's sale value would be the fourth largest for a United player after Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel di Maria. Garnacho, who played 93 Premier League matches for United, was among five players seeking to exit the club this summer, along with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho. Rashford joined Barcelona on loan last month. Manager Ruben Amorim has left Garnacho out of his squad this season, as United failed to win their first two Premier League games before being knocked out of the League Cup on penalties by fourth-tier Grimsby Town.

    "content": "Debunking DMP claim, frame by frame EC unveils roadmap for 13th national polls Amid rising poverty, what we can learn from China’s experience Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University students block road in Agargaon Bangladesh men's hockey team showed grit in their opening match of the 12th Men's Hockey Asia Cup, but eventually fell 4-1 to tournament favourites Malaysia at the Rajgir Sports Stadium in Bihar, India today. Drafted into the competition at short notice to replace Pakistan, Moshiur Rahman Biplob's side arrived with barely three weeks of preparation. Yet, their display was a marked improvement from the 2022 edition, when Malaysia had handed them an 8-1 defeat. Four years ago, penalty corner specialist Ashraful Islam was the lone scorer for Bangladesh, and this time too, Ashraful gave Bangladesh the lead in the 16th minute by converting a penalty corner after Malaysia were frustrated in the first quarter. Malaysia, who had struck in every quarter against Bangladesh in the 2022 edition, bounced back nine minutes later with Ashran Hamsani levelling the margin from open play in the 25th minute. Since then, they established control in the match and made it 2-1 before the half-time break as Akhimullah Anuar scored from open play in the 36th minute. Bangladesh, who lacked fitness following a short preparation, denied Malaysia in the third quarter but could not resist the speedy opponents in the final stages, conceding two more goals through Muhajir Abu Rauf and Syed Cholan in the 48th and 54th minutes, respectively. Bangladesh are grouped with Malaysia, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in Pool B fixtures of the eight-team tournament. রাজধানীর ঢাকার কাকরাইলে জাতীয় পার্টির কেন্দ্রীয় কার্যালয়ের সামনে গণঅধিকার পরিষদ ও জাপা নেতাকর্মীদের মধ্যে সংঘর্ষ হয়েছে।",
