    "title": "Unresolved issues of 71 Bangladesh does not agree with the claim made by Pakistan’s foreign minister",
    "content": "Foreign adviser Touhid Hossain disagreed with the claim made by Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar regarding the resolution of unresolved issues from 1971. He stated that both countries will continue discussions on the pending bilateral matters in the future. On Sunday morning, a bilateral meeting was held at the Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka between Pakistan’s foreign minister and Bangladesh’s foreign adviser. Later, in the afternoon, Touhid Hossain responded to various questions from journalists at the Foreign Service Academy regarding the discussions held during the meeting. When asked about Ishaq Dar's claim that unresolved issues between two countries have been resolved twice, the foreign adviser said, “We presented our respectives during the meeting. I can assure you that we clearly outlined our stance on three specific issues. Both sides acknowledged the need to resolve them. In order for bilateral relations to move forward smoothly, these matters need to be addressed and put behind us. Both sides agreed that we will continue talking about these issues. We will make an effort to have focused discussions on them at some point, so that they can be put to rest.” When asked about Bangladesh’s position on the three unresolved issues, the adviser said: “We want the financial matters—particularly the accounts—to be settled. We want an acknowledgment of the genocide that took place here, and an apology. We also want Pakistan to take back the stranded people. I clearly and firmly conveyed Bangladesh’s position.” “Surely, you don’t expect 54 years of unresolved issues to be solved in a single meeting today—especially a meeting that took place after 12 or 13 years, and only because Hina Rabbani invited us. It wasn’t even an official bilateral visit. Surely no one expects that we would sit down for an hour and resolve everything. We have presented each other’s positions,\" he added. In response to a question on whether the two countries share the same position regarding unresolved issues, Touhid Hossain said: “On the unresolved issues, both countries reiterated their respective positions. We both agreed that these matters need to be resolved so that they do not stand in the way of advancing bilateral relations. But we cannot expect to resolve these issues in a single meeting.” When asked whether he agrees with Ishaq Dar’s claim that the three issues have already been resolved twice, Touhid Hossain responded: “I do not agree at all. If I did, then the problem would have already been resolved. We have stated our position, and they have stated theirs. We have addressed all three issues.” When asked whether the recent series of meetings with Pakistan is the result of a trilateral initiative—especially involving a third country like China—the adviser dismissed that idea. Touhid Hossain said: “China is indeed interested in bilateral relations, and so is Pakistan. However, during the previous government’s tenure, relations with Pakistan were deliberately held back. We want our relationship with Pakistan to be just like it is with any other country.”",

    "title": "The very BNP men for whom I fought for 15 years pushed me: Rumeen",
    "content": "BNP’s international affairs secretary Rumeen Farhana blamed activists of Brahmanbaria BNP president for hooliganism inside the election commission headquarters today, Sunday. “I thought no one would bring in thugs inside out of respect for the election commission. But the candidate from Brahmanbaria-3 (Khaled Hossain Mahbub) brought 20–25 men and engaged in hooliganism. What hasn’t happened in 15 years happened today — they almost tried to push me to the ground. The very BNP leaders and activists for whom I’ve fought for 15 years pushed me,” Rumeen Farhana said. She spoke to reporters today, Sunday afternoon, after an incident of scuffle at the election commission building in Agargaon, Dhaka, during a hearing on the re-demarcation of parliamentary constituencies. “I brought gentlemen with me, not thugs. But they kept making baseless remarks. At the end, when I stood up to speak, I was shoved. When my people were beaten, they responded,” Rumeen said. Around 12 noon, the hearing began at the election commission. Shortly after, the discussion turned to the re-demarcation of the boundaries of Brahmanbaria-2 (Sarail–Ashuganj) and neighboring Brahmanbaria-3 (Sadar–Bijoynagar), Rumeen Farhana’s constituency. At one point, a scuffle broke out. The draft prepared by the election commission proposes transferring three unions of Bijoynagar upazila — Budhanti, Chandura, and Harashpur — from Brahmanbaria-3 (Sadar–Bijoynagar) to Brahmanbaria-2 (Sarail–Ashuganj). Rumeen Farhana supports this proposal. Explaining her stance, the BNP central leader said, “Our leader Khaleda Zia has always said BNP wants elections under the pre-2008 constituency boundaries. The current boundaries were set by the fascist government to suit their own interests. We want a return to the pre-2008 boundaries. “In the current boundary, there is no balance in the number of voters. Our constituency has about 420,000 voters, Bijoynagar has 610,000, and the Sadar has 600,000. If Budhanti, Chandura, and Harashpur unions are joined with Sarail, then voter numbers will be more balanced,” she explained. Rumeen also argued that geographically and socially, residents of the three unions are linked to Sarail. They conduct official and land registry work there, and travel is also easier via Sarail. Khaled Hossain Mahbub, BNP’s candidate aspirant for Brahmanbaria-3 and president of the district BNP — against whom Rumeen made her allegations — told reporters about the scuffle, “There was actually an argument between NCP and Barrister Rumeen Farhana. This was unfortunate and unwanted. It is deeply regrettable that such incidents happen at this level.” On boundary changes, he said, “Three out of Bijoynagar’s 10 unions have been attached to Sarail–Ashuganj on the basis of wrong information. These unions are geographically connected to Bijoynagar. We want them to remain in Brahmanbaria-3.” “The commission held the hearing. There was some commotion, where our opponents presented many false claims, which are not logical. We believe these three unions should remain with Sadar–Bijoynagar,” he added. Md Ataullah, Joint Chief Organiser of the National Citizen Party (NCP), accused Rumeen Farhana of assaulting him during the hearing.“When I stood up to speak, Rumeen Farhana pushed me down. Then her men started kicking and punching me. My panjabi was torn, and I was injured in the hand. Just like Chhatra League used to crush us on campus, they crushed me the same way,” said the NCP leader. He claimed the commission then allowed no one else to speak. “Except BNP, even Jamaat wasn’t given a chance to speak.” Aminul Haque Chowdhury, NCP’s coordinator for Brahmanbaria, told Prothom Alo that they want Bijoynagar to remain intact. “But during the hearing, Rumeen Farhana and her men attacked us. They threw us to the ground and trampled us right in front of the commission. This proves fair elections are not possible in this country.” In response to Ataullah’s allegations, Rumeen Farhana’s said, “The problem is, he isn’t a familiar face — I don’t know if he came from NCP or Jamaat. But the first person who pushed me was a man in a white panjabi. After that, of course my people didn’t just sit back. I’m a woman. Later, when my people were attacked, they retaliated. It’s simple.”",

    "title": "Postpone Bangladesh’s LDC graduation by 5-6 years: Business leaders",
    "content": "Bangladesh’s leading entrepreneurs and trade bodies on Sunday called on the government to seek five to six years  more before officially being graduated from the Least Developed Country (LDC) status as they said adequate preparation is needed to tackle post-graduation challenges. “Our entrepreneurs and business chambers strongly support graduation. However, we stress the need for a 5-6 years’ extension. This will allow both the government and private sector to prepare properly avoiding potential problems,” said ICC Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman. He made the remarks at a press briefing titled ‘LDC Graduation: Challenges Ahead’, organised by ICC Bangladesh in collaboration with major national trade organisations at a city hotel. He emphasised the importance of diversifying Bangladesh’s export basket, developing human capital for Industry 4.0, attracting quality foreign direct investment (FDI) and building resilience in a volatile global economy. “Successful graduation requires smart trade diplomacy to secure deals with the EU, the UK, Asean and Gulf countries to offset potential US tariff shocks. Reforms in financial governance, logistics, energy and technology-driven competitiveness are also essential,” he added. Highlighting economic concerns, Mahbubur Rahman pointed to external debt stress, declining FDI, global trade tensions, currency devaluation, energy shortages and post-July 2024 economic pressures. “The debate is not ‘if’ we graduate, but ‘how we graduate,” he said. He stressed that reforms, particularly in the financial and banking sectors, must be urgent but cannot happen overnight. BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan warned that the readymade garment sector, the biggest beneficiary of graduation, could suffer if the process is rushed. ICC Vice president Naser Ezaz Bijoy said ongoing global supply chain disruptions, political instability, and climate vulnerabilities reinforce the need for an extension. Bangladesh has already met the UN’s three criteria for graduation—Gross National Income, Human Assets Index and Economic Vulnerability Index—in two consecutive reviews, putting it on track for official graduation in November 2026. Rahman cited examples of countries like Maldives and Vanuatu, which delayed their graduation due to economic and political realities, saying a similar approach could benefit Bangladesh. Several top business leaders, including ICC Vice president AK Azad, DCCI senior vice president Razeev H Chowdhury, MCCI president Kamran T Rahman, FICCI board member Rubaba Dowla and BGMEA vice presidents, attended the briefing. The LDC graduation process, overseen by the United Nations Committee for Development Policy (UN-CDP), allows eligible countries to move out of the LDC category after meeting income, human asset, and economic vulnerability benchmarks. Graduating countries typically receive a three-year transition period to prepare for potential changes in trade access and concessional financing.",

    "title": "JUCSU: Army and BGB to be deployed for security",
    "content": "The election commission is taking various steps to ensure that the Jahangirnagar University Central Students’ Union (JUCSU) and hall union elections are held smoothly. On election day, members of the Army, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and Ansar, alongside the police, will also be on duty for security. This decision was made at a meeting of the JUCSU election commission yesterday, Saturday. For the first time in 33 years, elections will be held on 11 September for 25 JUCSU posts and 15 posts in each of the 21 residential halls. A total of 273 nomination papers have been submitted for the JUCSU polls. Scrutiny of the nomination papers will begin today, Sunday, and the draft candidate list will be published on 25 August. According to sources at the election commission office, in line with Saturday’s decision, 40 security personnel — 20 from the army and 20 from the BGB — will be deployed on election day. They will be stationed in front of the university’s main gate. In addition, at least five police officers will be deployed at each of the other university gates. However, ten police officers will be stationed at each of the following gates: the Mir Mosharraf Hossain Hall gate adjacent to the Dhaka–Aricha Highway, the Joy Bangla Gate (Prantik Gate), and the Bishmail Gate. Commission sources further said that five Ansar members will be on duty at every polling center. Teachers from various departments will serve as returning officers, while university officials and staff will also carry out different election-related responsibilities. Professor Mafruhi Sattar, member of the election commission and acting dean of the Faculty of Biological Sciences, told Prothom Alo, \"The election commission is making rigorous preparations to conduct the election properly. With everyone’s cooperation, we hope to deliver a free, fair, and successful election.\" According to the election commission office, there are 11,919 registered voters in this JUCSU election, of whom 5,817 — nearly 49 per cent — are female students. Despite making up almost half the electorate, women students are not contesting in at least five of the top JUCSU posts, including the vice president (VP) post. Number of female candidates is also very limited in other posts. Two female candidates collected nomination papers for the general secretary (GS) post, but one is expected to contest instead for assistant general secretary (AGS), while the other may withdraw from the GS race, according to sources. The deadline for withdrawing nomination papers is 28 August. Altogether, women students submitted 62 nomination papers, 48 of which were for six posts reserved specifically for female candidates. Since some women applied for multiple posts, the actual number of female candidates will be even lower once final choices are made. Similarly, in the hall union elections, women’s participation is also low. In five of the 10 women’s halls, all 15 positions have not been filled. Prothom Alo spoke with 30 female students from 10 women’s halls on Thursday and Friday to understand why women’s participation in JUCSU is so limited. Many said that although women were at the forefront of the July mass uprising, they have since faced cyberbullying through various university-based Facebook pages, groups, and “bot” accounts. Because of this, many who initially wanted to run decided not to. Some also said their families did not approve. Sohaagi Samia, an organiser of the university chapter of the Samajtantrik Chhatra Front, told Prothom Alo, \"The women who led from the front during the uprising have been deliberately targeted later to demean them socially. Moreover, the culture of ‘minus politics’ against women within most organisations still persists.\" Professor Nahrin Islam Khan of the Department of Geography and Environment observed, \"Women at Jahangirnagar have been at the forefront of movements and struggles since the 1980s and 1990s. But their low participation in JUCSU elections has many reasons. The bot forces not only bully and slut-shame female students but also attack female teachers who speak up.\" Several faculty members noted that the university administration failed to create enthusiasm among female students regarding JUCSU. Professor Mahmuda Akand of the Philosophy Department said, \"Students come to the university from diverse backgrounds. JUCSU is the platform for them to voice their rights. To make them aware of that, there should have been continuous discussions. If small group discussions had been held leading up to the election, female participation might have been higher.\" Pro Vice Chancellor (Administration) Professor Sohel Ahmed commented, \"When we worked on the JUCSU constitution, meetings were held in every hall, and these issues were discussed there too. Since JUCSU is happening after such a long gap, perhaps the response (from female students) has been less. But this is only the beginning — if the process continues, this problem will gradually be solved.\"",

    "title": "Clashes break out at constituency re-demarcation hearing",
    "content": "Scuffles broke out during a hearing on constituency boundary re-demarcation ahead of the upcoming 13th national parliamentary election. The hearing began at 12:00 noon today, Sunday, at the election commission (EC) office in Agargaon, Dhaka. The incident occurred around 1:00pm during the session. Md Ataullah, joint chief organiser of the National Citizen Party (NCP), alleged that he and his party members were attacked by former BNP lawmaker Rumeen Farhana and her party supporters. Rumeen Farhana, however, claimed that Ataullah was not a familiar face. “I don’t know whether he came from the NCP or the Jamaat. But first, he pushed me. My people could not just sit idle after that. They responded,\" she added. A video shown by Ataullah depicts Rumeen Farhana standing in front of the stage, while Ataullah is seen lying on the floor behind her, being kicked and punched by several individuals. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Ataullah said, “During the hearing, Rumeen Farhana presented her arguments. But when I tried to present mine, she pushed me down and seized the stage. Then her supporters started kicking me like a football. Just like Chhatra League members used to crush us on campus, they trampled me in front of everyone. They tore my punjabi, and I was injured in the hand.” When asked what the election commission did at the time, Ataullah replied that the EC did not allow anyone else to speak afterward. He claimed Jamaat-e-Islami was also not allowed to speak, besides BNP. Aminul Haque Chowdhury, NCP’s chief coordinator for Bijoynagar upazila in Brahmanbaria, told Prothom Alo, “Our demand is to keep Bijoynagar intact. Rumeen Farhana filed an application to carve out three unions. \"When we went to present our arguments, she and her thugs attacked us in front of the chief election commissioner and other commissioners. The way they trampled us in front of everyone proves that fair elections will never be held in this country.” Responding to NCP leaders’ allegations, Rumeen Farhana said, “The problem is that he (Ataullah) is not a known face. I don’t know if he’s from NCP or Jamaat. But he—wearing a white Punjabi—pushed me first. Then obviously my people wouldn’t sit idle. I am a woman. And later when my people were attacked, they responded too. It’s that simple.” She further claimed that Khaled Hossain Mahbub Shyamal, president of Brahmanbaria district BNP and a possible candidate for Brahmanbaria-3, had entered the EC building with hired thugs. “When I stood up to speak, someone shoved me to the ground. The very BNP workers for whom I fought for 15 years are now pushing me. If I am pushed, there will naturally be a push in return. That’s what happened,” Rumeen said. On the boundary issue, Rumeen Farhana said, “Khaleda Zia has always said BNP wants to contest elections on the pre-2008 boundaries. The current boundaries were drawn by a fascist government for its own interest, and we do not accept them. That is why we want a return to the pre-2008 demarcation.” The EC’s draft proposal cuts three unions—Budhanti, Chandura, and Harashpur—out of Brahmanbaria-3 (Sadar-Bijoynagar) and attaches them to Brahmanbaria-2 (Sarail-Ashuganj). Rumeen Farhana supports this change. Commenting on the scuffle, Khaled Hossain Mahbub Shyamal said, “What really happened here was a verbal altercation between NCP and Barrister Rumeen Farhana. It was unfortunate and undesirable. At this level, such incidents are very regrettable. … The commission conducted the hearing. There was some commotion, during which our opponents presented a lot of false information which had no logical basis. We believe these three unions should remain with Sadar-Bijoynagar.”",

    "title": "HSC admission: No students selected in 378 colleges and madrasahs",
    "content": "No students were selected for admission to 378 colleges and madrasahs across the country in the upcoming academic year. Additionally, 10 colleges received no applications at all. Under the Rajshahi Education Board, RMJ College has 150 seats available for admission to the 11th grade. However, not a single student was selected for admission there. Similarly, Jaflong Hanifa Khatun Memorial College in Sylhet has 300 seats, but no students were selected for admission either. The first phase results for admission to the 11th grade for the 2025–26 academic year were published on Wednesday. This information was revealed upon reviewing the published results. Meanwhile, 25,348 students were not selected for admission despite applying - among them are 5,765 students who achieved GPA-5. Admission to the 11th grade in all colleges and madrasahs across the country (except for a few institutions such as Notre Dame College) is being centrally coordinated. This centralised online admission process is conducted under the Dhaka Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, with technical support from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). No entrance exams are held under this system; students are selected based on their SSC and equivalent exam results. It is worth noting that admissions under the Technical Education Board follow a separate process. The results of the SSC and equivalent examinations were published on 10 July. This year, a total of 1,904,086 students registered under 11 education boards, of whom 1,303,426 passed. This means more than 600,000 students did not pass. According to the Dhaka Education Board, there are a total of 8,015 eligible colleges and madrasahs for admission this year, offering 2,563,063 seats for 11th-grade students. Against these seats, 1,073,310 eligible students applied. Of them, 1,047,962 students were selected for admission, while more than 25,000 students who applied were not selected. In this admission process, students must submit a fixed application fee and apply to a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 colleges or madrasahs, ranking them in order of preference. Based on a student’s academic merit, quota (if applicable), and preferences, they are placed in one of the institutions they applied to. According to the Dhaka Education Board, it has been observed that many students tend to apply mostly to well-known or familiar colleges and madrasahs. However, due to a mismatch between their results, preferences, and seat availability, not all applicants are selected for admission. There are, however, second and third phases of the admission process. Students who did not apply in the first phase will still have the opportunity to apply during these two later rounds. That said, options become more limited in the second and third phases, and the chances of getting into a preferred institution are significantly reduced. A list has been prepared of the top 10 colleges based on the number of applications received. Among them, the highest number of applications was submitted to Government Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh. This college has 981 seats, but received 36,185 applications for admission.The second highest was Adamjee Cantonment College in Dhaka, which has 2,161 seats and received 35,082 applications. The remaining eight institutions on the list are: BAF Shaheen College (Dhaka), Shaheed AHM Kamaruzzaman Government Degree College, Kabi Nazrul Government College, Rajshahi Government College, Baklia Government College, Government AH College (Bogura), Dinajpur Government College, and New Government Degree College. Number of institutions without any admitted students by education boardAccording to the Dhaka Education Board, of the 378 colleges and madrasahs where no students were selected for admission in the first phase, the breakdown by education board is as follows:Rajshahi: 56 institutionsDinajpur: 42 institutionsDhaka: 39 institutionsMymensingh: 35 institutionsJashore: 16 institutionsBarishal: 13 institutionsCumilla: 12 institutionsSylhet: 3 institutionsChattogram: 1 institutionMadrasahs (nationwide): 161 institutions A total of 10 colleges across the country did not receive a single application for admission. Of these, nine are under the Barishal Education Board. One such example is Kathalia Secondary Girls' School and College, which has 450 available seats — yet no students applied for admission there. Under the Chattogram Education Board, one college also received no applications. Regarding the 378 colleges and madrasahs that failed to enroll any students, and the 25,000+ students who applied but were not selected for admission anywhere, Prothom Alo spoke with Professor Khondoker Ehsanul Kabir, Chairman of the Dhaka Education Board and President of the Inter-Education Board Coordination Committee.

He is involved in various initiatives related to national interest, policy, and strategy. He spoke with Prothom Alo on issues such as the 2024 mass uprising, student politics, reforms, and elections. Interview taken by Monjurul Islam. Prothom Alo : You were very active as a teacher during mass uprising in July-August last year. The mass uprising has marked one year. To many people, the main aspiration of the mass uprising was democratic transition of the state. How much advancement has been made in this end, in your view? You were very active as a teacher during mass uprising in July-August last year. The mass uprising has marked one year. To many people, the main aspiration of the mass uprising was democratic transition of the state. How much advancement has been made in this end, in your view? Abdul Hasib Chowdhury:The main objective of the mass uprising was not actually the democratic transition of the state; that may have appeared separately or in parallel, but during the uprising these issues were not discussed much. The very clear objective of the mass uprising was the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina’s fascist government.In July–August last year, brutal attacks were carried out on the people, killings took place. Those who committed these acts had a political identity; at the same time, the government that carried them out was a client of India. After unleashing attacks and mass killings on the people, they became occupiers. The core aim of the mass uprising was to oust that occupying government.If we talk about democratic transition of the state, then that has to be part of the programmes of political parties. The biggest weakness of the 2024 mass uprising is that it had nothing of this kind. If we look back at the 1990 mass uprising, we can see that there was some consensus among the political parties, and there were many clear points. From the platforms of students, workers, lawyers, physicians, engineers, and women, there were also specific demands and programmes.  Those may not have been implemented—that’s another matter—but at least they existed. This time, however, there were no such agreed-upon demands or programmes. This is the biggest weakness of the 2024 mass uprising.A common characteristic of most student movements and mass uprisings in Bangladesh has been anti-imperialism. But this time that element was absent. This too is a weakness of the mass uprising.

    "title": "Commissioner stays in Dhaka, roads closed for entry into Gazipur",
    "content": "Gazipur, Tongi College Gate. 14 August, 10:00 am. Not a single vehicle is moving on the Dhaka-bound flyover. Two traffic officers stand at the road’s entrance, with a long queue of halted vehicles below. The reason: the police commissioner is arriving. The flyover is kept clear for the Gazipur Police Commissioner’s protocol. During this time, commuters, office bound people, and students all face travel disruption. Many people trapped in traffic do not even know that the city’s top law enforcement officer resides in another city. Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan lives in Dhaka, commuting daily from his Gulshan residence. On his way to Gazipur, the flyover at Tongi College Gate is made one-way, blocking traffic from Gazipur to Dhaka. Similarly, on his return via the Bhogra area flyover, Dhaka-bound traffic is stopped. On 14 August at 10:15 am, these correspondents started traveling from Gazipur toward Dhaka. At Tongi College Gate, police stopped vehicles at the flyover entrance. When asked why, two duty traffic officers, Rafiqul Islam and Shahidul Islam, said, “The Commissioner is arriving from Dhaka now, so vehicles cannot enter the flyover. Once ‘Sir’ reaches Gazipur, all lanes toward Dhaka will reopen.” This creates long lines in the Dhaka-bound lanes. Abdul Matin, a CNG auto-rickshaw driver, told Prothom Alo, “Except Fridays and Saturdays, almost every day from morning to noon, no vehicles are allowed on the flyover toward Dhaka. This causes severe congestion in the adjacent lanes.” An internal police report confirms this practice. It notes that when Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan travels from Dhaka to Gazipur, no vehicles are allowed on the Dhaka-bound flyover from 8:00 am to 11:00 am or 12:00 pm in noon. Similarly, when he returns to his Gulshan residence in the evening, Gazipur-bound lanes are closed, causing serious inconvenience for commuters, students, and office-goers. Prothom Alo spoke to Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan on 14 and 21 August. He said, “Simply put, disturbances happen when I go to Gazipur. Secretaries and advisers travel around Dhaka with protection, yet no disturbance occurs. I don’t have a residence there. I had requested a bungalow in Gazipur to move my family there. You should write a news report for a bungalow to be built.” Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan was appointed GMP Commissioner on 11 November last year. On 1 May this year, he became President of the Bangladesh Police Service Association. Multiple GMP officers told Prothom Alo that there is no government residence in Gazipur for the commissioner. Therefore, he commutes from his Gulshan residence. Two other Additional Commissioners, Zahidul Hasan and Taherul Haque Chauhan, also live in Dhaka and commute similarly. Questions have arisen about the white Prado car the commissioner uses. It is unclear whether it is government-owned or private. No full registration number was visible. An internal police report states that when Muhammad Ibrahim Khan was deputy commissioner (traffic), he purchased a car for the current commissioner. It is a while car, with registration number “Dhaka-694 Sh.” Ibrahim Khan allegedly used funds obtained from seized vehicles for this. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, formerly of GMP under the previous Awami League government, was made OSD in the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Public Safety Division on 25 February. On 6 August, he was attached to the Khulna Range DIG office. When asked, Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan told Prothom Alo, “I don’t trust hearsay. Send the report to me. Investigations should be done. I suspect it might have involved some adviser too. If it came to me, he might have managed others too. Why isn’t it being investigated?” Attempts to reach Muhammad Ibrahim Khan by phone were unsuccessful. He was contacted by SMS too, but to no avail. According to police records, Ibrahim Khan, while deputy commissioner (Lalbagh Division, DMP), allegedly assisted a land grabber in Old Dhaka to encroach a piece of land owned by a freedom fighter. He was temporarily suspended on 11 September 2019, and later transferred to Gazipur. Visiting Gazipur in person reveals that after the mass uprising, workers in the industrial city frequently protest on the streets over various demands. Garment workers and others block roads and march, often paralysing the city. Students also stage demonstrations. During such times, senior police officers must be present for monitoring, decision-making, and coordination. Absence of the Commissioner makes it harder to manage the situation. Commissioner Nazmul Karim Khan said regarding this issue, “There is industrial police for the industrial city. If the workers come onto the metropolitan roads, then ask the industrial police why the workers from their area are coming into the city. In that case, instruct the industrial police to take necessary measures. Similarly, students are supposed to be in school; if they occupy the streets instead of attending school",

    "title": "Domestic gas fields Gas reserves are running out",
    "content": "The country's gas reserves are running out. Production is declining continuously. If new gas fields are not discovered and extraction from new mines is not started, domestic reserves may run out in the next eight years. Currently, 1.8 billion cubic feet of gas is extracted from domestic gas fields per day. In 2017, it was around 2.7 billion cubic feet. That is, domestic gas extraction has decreased by 33 per cent. When production from domestic sources decreases, dependence on gas imports increases. For that, a large sum of foreign currency has to be spent which affects foreign currency reserves. In 2018, the then Awami League government started importing gas. It was a major reason behind the increase in the price of the dollar to 123 taka and the hike in the prices of all products. Subsequently the country’s forex reserve started declining while pay for the import and the price of dollar has been increasing since then. Along with this, gas prices have had to be increased in phases. It is the common people who will have to pay for this. The prices of cooking oil, sugar, and other essential goods would not have risen so much, and the cost of living would not have increased to this extent, had the government been able to keep prices under control by increasing the production of natural gas from domestic gas fields. The cost per unit (cubic metre) of domestic gas is around Tk 3, while importing it from abroad costs about 55 taka. This low cost is due to the current low price of gas. Economists and industrialists say that US President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs on various countries has created an opportunity for Bangladesh's export sector and investment. To seize this opportunity, a secure and affordable energy supply is essential, making it crucial to increase the production of domestic gas. The government understands this and has taken initiatives to boost domestic production. Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, the adviser to the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, told Prothom Alo that three strategies have been adopted, considering the country's gas reserves: increasing production by drilling more wells, expanding gas exploration on land and at sea to discover new reserves, and constructing a land-based terminal to increase import capacity. In addition, gas usage will be controlled by preventing theft and waste. According to sources at the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla), the last survey on the country's gas reserves was conducted in 2010. At that time, a foreign company scientifically calculated the reserves, which were estimated to be 28.79 TCF (trillion cubic feet) of extractable gas. By the end of the 2022-23 financial year, 20.33 TCF of gas had been extracted, leaving approximately 8.5 TCF in reserve. In 2023, Petrobangla had the gas-extracting companies conduct a new review of the reserves. This review found that by the 2023-24 financial year, the reserves stood at nearly 30 TCF. However, by that time, approximately 22 TCF of gas had been produced, leaving about 8 TCF in reserve. Currently, the country produces an average of just under 0.75 TCF of gas per year. At this rate, the remaining reserves are expected to last for another 11 years. However, experts say that a significant amount of gas must be left in the mines at the end of extraction because it is no longer commercially viable to extract, even though it is counted in the reserve figures. Taking these factors into account, experts estimate that the remaining gas will last for about eight more years at the current extraction rate. According to Petrobangla, there are currently 29 gas fields in the country, with 20 of them in production. Of the remaining fields, four have been discovered but are not yet extracting gas. These are Ilisha and Bhola North in Bhola, Zakiganj in Sylhet, and Kutubdia. The necessary pipelines and other infrastructure to extract gas from these fields have not yet been built. Production has been stopped at various times in the remaining five fields even though they contain 661 BCF (billion cubic feet) of gas, as this gas is not commercially extractable. These fields are Rupganj in Narayanganj, Chhatak in Sylhet, Kamta in Gazipur, Feni, and Sangu (Chattogram). As of 1 July 2024, the remaining reserves in Titas, Brahmanbaria, are almost 2 TCF. Bibiyana, in Habiganj, holds 1.66 TCF, and Moulvibazar, in Sylhet, has about 20 BCF of gas. Jalalabad has less than 700 BCF in reserve. The remaining fields, including Bakhrabad, Kailashtila, and Rashidpur in Sylhet, also have a moderate amount of gas reserves. The Awami League government, which was ousted in the July mass uprising, abandoned gas exploration in favour of imports. At that time, two terminals were built in Moheshkhali, Cox's Bazar, where ships would bring in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), which was then converted and sent into pipelines. Gas imports began in 2018. At the time, the price of gas on the world market was low, and the ",

Meanwhile, CU Chhatra League President Rejaul Haque Rubel claimed that he identified five people who were involved in the crime. \"One of the five is Azim Hossain, a follower of BCL sub-group 'CFC'. Azim knows about the rest of the culprits. I got five names from him,\" Rubel told this correspondent. Asked about the findings, Assistant Proctor Shahidul Islam said, \"He [Rubel] is not a part of the probe body. He cannot claim this.\" Besides, a friend of the victim who went to the proctor's office to lodge complaint that night had a peek at the CCTV footage of the incident and confirmed Azim's involvement. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are dire",

    "title": "Yet-to-start mega projects: Consider putting  them on hold",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The High Court yesterday came down hard on Bangladesh Railway for mismanagement, ticket scalping and carrying passengers on the train roofs. \"If any train carries passengers on its roof, appropriate actions will be taken against the officials concerned,\" said the court. The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recomme",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver. We are searching for information on the driver,\" he told The Daily Star. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "title": "Energy crisis: Piecemeal steps won’t solve it",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280.

    "title": "Rohingya youth call for justice, dignity and safe return at Cox’s Bazar dialogue",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit At a dialogue on the Rohingya crisis today, attended by government officials, political leaders, foreign delegates and international NGOs, young voices of the Rohingya community shared their stories of discrimination, displacement and hope for a dignified return. \"Our future is ambition with hope,\" said Furkan Mizan as he recalled the years of discrimination he endured in Myanmar. \"As a Rohingya student when I was in Myanmar, I faced countless hardships, discrimination and unjust treatment. When I went to school, I was not given equal attention as members of other indigenous groups. Despite excelling in studies, my right to education and higher studies was taken away. I was not allowed to attend university.\" His voice trembled as he compared his life in Myanmar with being \"trapped inside a cage, unable to breathe freely.\" That cage closed in completely in 2017, when waves of Rohingya fled a military crackdown. \"We were forcibly displaced to our neighbouring country. Our right to live in our own motherland was taken away. We became refugees unwillingly. We never wanted this life,\" Mizan said. The programme, titled \"Voice of Rohingya: Right to Life, Justice, and Dignified Return to Homeland – Confidence-Building Measures towards a Conducive Environment for the Participants of Rohingya\", was organised by the Bangladesh government at Hotel Baywatch in Cox's Bazar. The conference will end on August 28. Taking the stage after Mizan, Sahu Asyus expressed gratitude to Bangladesh and the international community for giving the Rohingyas a platform, but reminded the audience that their demand is not charity, it is justice. \"For us, repatriation is not just about physically returning to our homeland. It is about returning with rights, with dignity, and with the guarantee that we will never flee again and never face persecution again. We long to return to our motherland as soon as possible, but not just to survive,\" he said. Asyus laid out the conditions that must be met: full citizenship rights, accountability for perpetrators, restoration of homes and livelihoods, and freedom of movement. \"The denial of our citizenship remains the greatest obstacle. Without legal recognition, we fear we will remain voiceless, stateless, and excluded from opportunities to live a dignified life,\" he said. He pointed to ongoing militarisation in Rakhine, continued atrocities, and fresh waves of Rohingya fleeing into Bangladesh. \"No one feels safe to return under such conditions. We need to make it safer for us.\" His own life bore the scars of discrimination. In 2012, he was a second-year student at Sittwe University when communal violence broke out. He was expelled and never allowed to return. \"Our education was totally banned. Our movement was totally banned. We could not even visit our relatives in other villages without permits from the army and police,\" he said. Asyus made an urgent plea for international accountability. \"Not a single perpetrator of genocide against the Rohingyas has been held accountable yet. Without justice and guarantees of non-repetition, history will repeat itself,\" he said. The first day's programme included a special interactive session with Rohingya representatives on confidence-building measures towards a conducive environment for the repatriation of Rohingyas. High Representative for the Rohingya Issue and National Security Adviser of Bangladesh Khaliur Rahman and Foreign Secretary Asad Alam Siam were among attendees in the session, where Rohingya representatives from different camps in Bangladesh, as well as the Rohingya diaspora, also joined. The programme was moderated by Rohingya community leaders Lucky Karim, Mohammed Rofique and Omar Salma. Soyedullah, Furquan Mirza, Abdullah, Hujjout Ullah, Sahat Zia Hero, Abdul Amin, Jaitun Nara, Jihin Noor and Abdullah and Ro Mujif Khan spoke at the session. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Thomas H Andrews also joined the session. Among others, representatives of the resident diplomatic missions, UN agencies, international organisations, media, experts and civil society were in attendence. United Nations Resident Coordinator (UNRC-ai) Rana Flowers, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) Nicholas Koumjian, and Assistant High Commissioner, UNHCR Raouf Mazou also attended the session. Representatives of major political parties, including BNP, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party, Islami Andolan Bangladesh, and Gono Odhikar Parishad, also joined the session. Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus will inaugurate the main session of the conference on Monday. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit The interim government has decided to stop leasing waterbodies to non-fishermen in order to protect the rights and livelihoods of professional fishing communities, Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter said today. She said permission has already been obtained from the land ministry to resolve the leasing issues of the baors, which are typically perennial waterbodies formed when a river shifts. The adviser made the comments today at the closing ceremony of National Fish Week 2025, organised by the Department of Fisheries at the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in the capital. At present, the expected amount of fish is not being obtained from the waterbodies, leaving genuine fishermen deprived, she mentioned. Hilsa production depends on nature, said Md Abdur Rouf, director general of the Department of Fisheries. In many places, due to obstacles, hilsa cannot move from the sea to the rivers, which causes the catch to decrease and prices to rise, he said, adding that initiatives will be taken to establish designated zones to expand shrimp farming. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

The decision came from a meeting of the National Moon Sighting Committee held this evening at the Islamic Foundation Conference Room in Baitul Mukarram National Mosque, with Religious Affairs Secretary AKM Aftab Hossain Pramanik in the chair. The meeting announced that as the moon of Rabiul Awal, 1446 Hijri, was not sighted in Bangladesh today, the holy month of Rabiul Aawal will begin on Tuesday. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, on the 12th of Rabiul Awal in the year 570 AD, and he passed away on the same date in 632 AD.

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Local and national organisations, along with humanitarian actors, have called for a clear roadmap for Rohingya repatriation, stressing that Cox's Bazar cannot bear further pressure as Bangladesh marks the eighth anniversary of the Rohingya influx. The appeal came at a webinar titled on the Rohingya crisis and sustainable solution organized by COAST Foundation and the Cox's Bazar CSO-NGO Forum (CCNF) today. Moderated by COAST Director Mustafa Kamal Akand and CCNF Member Secretary Jahangir Alam, the event featured speakers including refugee expert Gawhar Nayeem Wara, Whykong Union Parishad Chairman Noor Ahmad Anwari, advocate Saki A Kawsar, Palongkhali Union's Mojaffar Ahamed, journalist Imam Khair, Save the Cox's Bazar Chairman Tauhid Belal, AGRAJATRA's Mohammad Helal Uddin, and NGO Platform representatives Amir Hossen and Sukarna Abdullah. Gawhar Nayeem Wara said progress will be limited unless Rohingyas are recognised as refugees with rights. \"Education is a fundamental right of Rohingya children that cannot be denied,\" he noted, urging greater use of local resources in aid operations and calling for a concrete roadmap. Presenting the keynote, COAST's Assistant Director Shahinur Islam warned that 1.15 million Rohingyas remain entirely dependent on aid. With recent funding cuts, humanitarian assistance has been reduced, threatening both refugees and host communities. He also urged accountability for Myanmar's military over genocide and crimes against humanity. Advocate Saki A Kawsar alleged Rohingya involvement in drug trafficking and human trafficking cases and called for a separate court to handle such matters. Noor Ahmad Anwari said the promised allocation of 25 percent of aid for host communities was not working effectively and urged a comprehensive employment policy for locals. \"Law and order has deteriorated. Repatriation is the only sustainable solution,\" he added. Palongkhali's Mojaffar Ahamed pointed out that children born during the 2017 influx now have major needs. \"Cutting aid is not an option, otherwise the pressure will fall on locals,\" he warned. Speakers highlighted worsening camp security. \"Armed groups are active inside the camps, delaying repatriation,\" said Mohammad Helal Uddin, who also suggested exploring third-country resettlement. Journalist Imam Khair urged the next elected government to prioritise the crisis once the interim administration's tenure ends. Abdur Rahman Hashemy added, \"The people of Cox's Bazar cannot take one more Rohingya.\" NGO representatives emphasised long-term assistance, peaceful coexistence, skill development, and regional advocacy. \"Food security and permanent solutions must be the focus. The voices of both Rohingyas and host communities must be heard, and ASEAN's role must be utilized,\" said Sukarna Abdullah. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Large-scale prisoner exchanges were the only tangible result of three rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul between May and July. They remain one of the few areas of cooperation between the two countries since Russia's offensive began in 2022. \"On August 24, 146 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory controlled\" by Kyiv, the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram. \"In exchange, 146 prisoners of war of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were transferred\" to Ukraine, it added. Russia also said that \"eight citizens of the Russian Federation -- residents of the Kursk region, illegally detained\" by Kyiv were also returned as part of the exchange. Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region in August last year, seizing hundreds of square kilometres (miles) of territory in a major setback for the Kremlin. Russia deployed thousands of troops from its ally North Korea as part of a counterattack, but did not fully reclaim control of the region until April. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

A murder case has been filed with Sadarghat River Police Station against unnamed persons, said Sohag Rana, officer-in-charge of the police station. The body of the child was found floating near Mirerbagh Cold Storage around 12:30pm yesterday. About an hour later, the body of the woman, aged around 25, was recovered from the same spot. \"We suspect the woman was the mother of the child,\" the OC said. Besides, another murder case was filed with Keraniganj Model Police Station over the recovery of the bodies of two people whose hands were tied together, said Monirul Haque Dablu, officer-in-charge of the police station. The two bodies -- a woman aged around 30 and a man aged about 40 -- were recovered from the Barishur area. Sources at Sir Salimullah Medical College morgue, where autopsies were carried out today, said the child and the woman were murdered by strangulation. Viscera and other samples were collected for chemical analysis to determine the cause of death of the two others, the sources said. Meanwhile, the four bodies remain unclaimed as of the filing of the report around 7:00pm today. Their identities could not be confirmed as no one has come forward to claim them, said Abdullah Al Mamun, superintendent of Dhaka district river police. Fingerprint matching could not be conducted as the bodies had already decomposed and their fingerprints were unusable, he told The Daily Star around 3:15pm. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

The court also issued a rule asking the respondents to explain why they should not be directed to reinstate the terminated officers of Al-Arafah Islami Bank to their offices. The bench of Justice Md Akram Hossain Chowdhury and Justice Foyej Ahmed came up with the order and rule following a writ petition filed by 300 terminated officers challenging legality of the central bank's decision for termination. Governor and general manager of the Bangladesh Bank, managing director of Al-Arafah Islami Bank and its senior vice president and head of its human resources department have been made respondents to the rule. Barrister Shanjid Siddique, a lawyer of the petitioners, told The Daily Star that the Al-Arafah Islami Bank officials were terminated on July 20 without prior notice and without being any specific allegation against them. They were permanent employees and serving in different branches for over four years, the lawyer said, adding that an application was submitted to the Bangladesh Bank governor on July 28 seeking their reinstatement.

Hasnat spoke at the Election Commission building in Dhaka around 4:00pm. He alleged that the commission has been \"shamelessly favouring a particular party\" and acting to \"implement that party's agenda,\" which he described as the main barrier to holding free and fair elections. \"We have repeatedly said that we want to move toward a fair, acceptable, and neutral election,\" the NCP leader said. \"The people of Bangladesh are waiting for a democratic transition. But they do not want to return to a reign of hooliganism, nor do they want another 1/11-type situation.\" \"The role played by the Commission has always been questionable to us. We saw the police acting as silent spectators. We also saw how the police obstructed our leaders and activists from entering the Election Commission, while BNP leaders and activists were given free entry,\" he said. \"Where the remote control of this Election Commission remains is unknown to us. If the commissioners feel that they cannot run this Commission, then make it clear to the people. We have already seen the Nurul Huda Commission in the recent past. We have also seen its consequences,\" he said. \"People of Bangladesh do not want to head toward another managed election. And within the BNP, there are many who act more like Awami League than the Awami League itself. Among them is Rumeen Farhana -- an Awami League beneficiary, and one who, through thuggery, wants to silence the Election Commission and push the country again toward a manipulated election,\" Hasnat alleged. Md Ataullah, NCP's Joint Chief Organiser for the southern region, also came forward with serious allegations, claiming he was assaulted by BNP supporters led by Rumeen Farhana during a hearing at the EC office. Ataullah, who is from Bijoynagar upazila under the Brahmanbaria-3 constituency, said he filed an appeal regarding constituency boundary changes that merged parts of Bijoynagar into Brahmanbaria-2. \"I was repeatedly threatened not to attend the hearing. Rumeen Farhana and her thugs told me to step aside,\" Ataullah alleged. \"When I entered before noon, I saw BNP leaders presenting their arguments. As soon as it was my turn to speak, she shoved me to the ground, and her supporters brutally beat me. Everything was captured on CCTV.\" Demanding justice, Ataullah called for Rumeen Farhana's arrest and \"exemplary punishment,\" adding, \"If justice is not served, the chief election commissioner must resign.\" তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

We expect to finalise the voter list soon.\" The first Cucsu election was held in 1970. Though the polls were supposed to take place annually, CU authorities have managed to hold them only six times. The last election took place on February 8, 1990. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi today called on the interim government to guarantee a free and fair election, stressing that only an elected government has the mandate to amend the constitution in the nation's interest. \"If any amendment to the constitution is needed in the interest of the country, it should be done by an elected government,\" he said while talking to reporters after distributing raincoats among rickshaw and van pullers in front of BNP's Nayapaltan central office in the capital. The BNP leader said the achievement made on August 5 must be maintained, mentioning that people had endured sixteen years of oppression under a repressive government. Rizvi said, \"There was no rule of law, no justice. The state machinery, including the judiciary and law enforcement, was used to serve the vendetta of Sheikh Hasina.\" \"A reign had been established where no one but Sheikh Hasina, her children and relatives had the right to speak. It was a rule of bloodshed and vengeance. If we don't want a repeat of that era, a minimum level of political understanding is essential,\" he added. He also emphasised that the interim government must remain neutral and live up to public expectations. \"It's not that they lack sincerity. Inflation has now come down, although prices of essentials remain high. But employment is not increasing. One after another, factories are shutting down. Without job creation, signs of famine may begin to appear. Perhaps a few advisers can afford duck meat anywhere they wish, but the general people cannot. Such a situation must not be allowed to arise,\" he said. He said, \"If a change is required for the July charter, then a future elected parliament will decide. One political party says a referendum must be held beforehand. Why? Fundamental principles are indivisible, but even then, the Constitution allows amendments. And only a parliament can do that.\" If any constitutional change is required for democracy, the elected representatives will do it, he added. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Meanwhile, Golam Azam, inspector of DMP's transport division, has been made the new OC of Shah Ali Police Station. Earlier in February, residents of Mohammadpur and adjacent areas staged demonstrations demanding Iftekhar's removal amid a rise in muggings, teenage gang activities, and other crimes. Last month, a man also alleged misconduct by several police officials, including the Mohammadpur OC, when he approached them after being mugged. Although four policemen were removed over the allegation, the OC had remained in his post until today's transfer. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

According to the schedule, forms were to be distributed from 10:00am today, but activities were delayed and the form collection began around 1:15pm. The first form was collected by Sajibur Rahman, a student of Islamic History and Culture, who will contest the Assistant General Secretary (AGS) post as an independent candidate. Later, Mst. Nisha Akter from the Bangla department became the first female candidate to collect a nomination form, for the post of Women's Affairs Secretary. Two other students also collected forms for GS, Cultural Affairs, and AGS, Sports and Games. Rucsu Treasurer and Chief Returning Officer Prof Setaur Rahman said students were collecting forms enthusiastically. Returning Officer Mahbubul Islam said four forms had been issued so far, adding that turnout was low due to protests but expected it to rise. Nomination forms will be available until 5:00pm on August 26 at the Rucsu treasurer's office and respective hall provosts' offices. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

While the performance wasn't particularly dominant, Mahbubur Rahman Litu's side secured a comfortable win courtesy of goals from Thuinuye Marma, Sauravi Akanda Prity, and Reya. The result sees Bangladesh remain second in the four-team table with six points from three matches. India, who had previously beaten Bangladesh 2-0, lead the standings with a perfect record of nine points. Earlier in the day, India demolished Bhutan 8-0 and now boast a goal difference of +17, compared to Bangladesh's +3. All four teams face each other twice in the tournament, with the return fixtures set for Tuesday -- Bangladesh will again take on Nepal, while India meet Bhutan. Bangladesh could have in fact finished with a much bigger margin of victory had Prity, last year's U-16 top scorer, converted more of her chances. She missed several opportunities, including a golden chance in the 35th minute after powering past multiple defenders, only to shoot wide from inside the box. The breakthrough came six minutes later when Thuinuye fired into the top-left corner from just inside the box, capitalising on Nepal's failure to clear a cross from Mamoni Chakma. Four minutes after that, Prity doubled the lead with a strike from outside the area, punishing Nepal goalkeeper Laxmi Oli for rushing out to clear a long ball intended for Alpi Akter. Bangladesh, however, struggled to maintain momentum in the second half. Nepal created more chances, with Sahara Limbu striking the post in the 55th minute before failing to beat goalkeeper Yearzan Bagum in a one-on-one just minutes later. Prity came close again late in the match, hitting the near post twice, while Thuinuye also rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort. Eventually, substitute forward Reya sealed the win a minute before full-time, rounding the keeper and finishing confidently. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

The 27-year-old, who has been in and around the Australian set-up for several years, was originally named to feature in the current one-day series against South Africa. But he pulled out at the last minute after experiencing lower back pain in the lead up, with further investigation revealing a lumbar bone stress injury. Morris said he had decided to have surgery. \"I feel this is the most logical way to realise my full potential and return to my very best cricket for the Perth Scorchers, Western Australia and Australia long into the future,\" he said in a statement. \"I also take great confidence in others who have undergone similar procedures and returned to their best. I plan to work hard through my recovery and return when the time is right.\" Cricket Australia said he would likely be sidelined for 12 months, ending his hopes of an Ashes debut. Morris was seen as a potential fifth pace option for the campaign against England as back-up to Pat Cummins, Mitchell Marsh, Josh Hazlewood and Scott Boland. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Son buried a first-half free kick in LAFC's 1-1 draw with FC Dallas while Mueller delivered the game-winning penalty in the 14th minute of second-half stoppage time to give the Whitecaps a 3-2 triumph over St. Louis City. Son, the former Tottenham captain who signed with LAFC this month for a reported MLS record $26 million transfer fee, made his third appearance, and second start, for his new club. Six minutes into the contest in suburban Dallas, Son took the free kick -- awarded on Chris Cappis's foul on LAFC's Denis Bouanga -- from 25 yards out. He lofted it over the wall with enough pace to beat Dallas goalkeeper Michael Collodi. \"I'm glad I scored the first goal for the MLS and also for LAFC,\" Son said. \"But for me, the most important thing is to get three points. I'm really, really disappointed for that.\" Son has wasted no time in making his presence felt. His first goal comes a week after he delivered an assist in LAFC's 2-0 win over New England Revolution. \"I need still a lot of time to be connecting with the team,\" said Son, who will play his first home game next weekend when LAFC host playoff-bound San Diego. \"It's been only two weeks -- maybe a little bit more than two weeks. But I'm enjoying every single moment.\" Logan Farrington scored the equalizer for Dallas in the 13th minute, and while LAFC dominated possession, they couldn't find another goal. \"I thought we dominated the game,\" Son said. \"We created chances, but not scoring goals throughout the game, I think it's really disappointing.\" Mueller's effort may have been a bit more satisfying, since it clinched a come-from-behind victory for his new club. After coming on as a sub last week, Mueller got his first start for Vancouver, who gave the Germany and Bayern Munich icon the captain's armband. \"That I was able to score the final goal in front of our crowd here -- it was an amazing feeling, amazing,\" Mueller said. Brian White also converted a penalty for Vancouver, pulling the Whitecaps level at 1-1 after Eduard Loewen opened the scoring for St. Louis in the 13th minute. Joao Klauss put St. Louis ahead in the 73rd before substitute Daniel Rios pulled Vancouver even at 2-2 in the 79th. Vancouver are now third in the Western Conference led by expansion club San Diego -- who had already become the first club to clinch an MLS Cup playoff berth before their goalless draw with Portland. Elsewhere, Inter Miami, playing without injured Argentine superstar Lionel Messi as they rested all but three of their regular starters, were held to a 1-1 draw at D.C. United -- who were eliminated from MLS Cup playoff contention. Baltasar Rodriguez scored his first career MLS goal for Inter, grabbing the equalizer in the 64th minute, slotting home a corner by Rodrigo De Paul. Jackson Hopkins had put United ahead in the 13th with his second goal in as many games. Inter are fifth in the Eastern Conference standings, eight points behind leaders Philadelphia, who defeated Chicago 4-0 on Saturday. Philadelphia's 54 points are two more than Cincinnati -- who fell 1-0 at home to New York City FC. Nashville are four points back in third after thumping Orlando 5-1. Sam Surridge and Hany Mukhtar scored two goals apiece for Nashville, with Surridge taking his tally for the season to a league-leading 20 -- one more than eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Iga Swiatek insisted Saturday she does not see herself as favorite for the US Open despite an impressive run of recent form that has left her as the player to beat according to oddsmakers. The 24-year-old Polish second seed arrived in New York fresh from capturing her first Cincinnati Open title, which came just weeks after a breakthrough victory at Wimbledon in July. Swiatek, though, played down suggestions that her recent wins meant she was the favorite to capture her second US Open title and what would be the seventh Grand Slam win of her career. \"Honestly, I think it doesn't make sense to call anyone the favorite,\" the 2022 US Open champion said Saturday. \"Women's tennis, I wouldn't say it's unpredictable because there are some girls that are constantly in the top and we are proving that we can play well throughout the whole season. But there are many players that play really good and can win the tournament.\" Swiatek added though that she is comfortable dealing with the burden of expectation. \"I got used to the expectations,\" she said. \"Obviously after winning so many things, they are always going to be there.\" Swiatek's victories at Wimbledon and Cincinnati suggested that the former world number one is becoming a more consistent threat on faster surfaces after being regarded as a clay-court specialist earlier in her career. Swiatek said Saturday that adapting to faster surfaces had been the focus of her preseason preparations with new coach Wim Fissette, who she hired in October last year. \"We really focused on that,\" Swiatek revealed. \"The whole preseason was basically all about that. \"I would say after Roland Garros I kind of got back to my usual self. The process of learning all this stuff that I learned in preseason kind of came back, and for sure I used it on Wimbledon and on hard court in Cincinnati. \"We'll see what's going to come next.\" Swiatek opens her US Open campaign on Monday against Colombia's Emiliana Arango. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Carlos Alcaraz is hoping to end Jannik Sinner's dominance of hardcourt Grand Slam events as the two rivals prepare to do battle again at the US Open. World number one Sinner is chasing back-to-back US Open titles in New York to set alongside his Australian Open victories in 2024 and 2025. The 24-year-old Italian has not lost a Grand Slam hardcourt match since being ousted in the fourth round of the US Open by Alexander Zverev two years ago. Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in the Cincinnati Open final last Monday when the ailing Italian retired in the first set when trailing 5-0, said Saturday that ending Sinner's Grand Slam streak would \"be (a) great thing to do.\" \"I think the last three Grand Slams on hard court he won, if I'm not wrong,\" Alcaraz said. \"It's been unbelievable the tennis he's bringing on hard courts. \"So I just look up to him in some way just to be ready if I have to face him somewhere. It's gonna be great.. . Hopefully, you know, meet him in the final. He has a big target, (on) his back.\" Alcaraz and Sinner's rivalry has captivated men's tennis in recent seasons, with the two men already facing off in two Grand Slam finals this year. Alcaraz won a five-set thriller to claim the French Open in June before Sinner hit back to defeat Alcaraz at Wimbledon the following month. Alcaraz also defeated Sinner in an epic five-set quarter-final on his way to victory at the 2022 US Open. \"Every time we face against each other on court, we raise the level to the top,\" Alcaraz said of his good-natured rivalry with Sinner. \"The respect we have (for) each other and the good relationship we have off the court -- I think it is great,\" the Spaniard said. Alcaraz, 22, suffered an upset second round exit at last year's US Open, but believes he is better positioned to prosper this year without having to manage the additional demands of an Olympic tournament in the lead-in. \"It's much different. I have more time just to have my days completely off, just to recharge my mind, my batteries,\" Alcaraz said, adding that the additional rest had left him \"hungry\" to play in Cincinnati. \"As you could see, I was more prepared than last year,\" he said. \"Now I'm just feeling much better.\" Alcaraz launches his US Open title bid against Reilly Opelka in Monday's first round. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Milan were level at the break through Strahinja Pavlovic's header in the final moments of the first half but Massimiliano Allegri's team failed to capitalise on chances created early in the second period and were punished by Bonazzoli who gave Cremonese their first ever win over Milan at the San Siro. \"If you look at the performance we had more chances but the difference in these matches is the determination with which you attack and defend,\" said Allegri. \"We conceded two avoidable goals due to being slack... it's like we're not aware of danger.\" Roma got off to a positive start under new coach Gian Piero Gasperini with a 1-0 win over Bologna, new boy Wesley Franca pouncing on a Jhon Lucumi error to bundle in the only goal of the game in the 43rd minute. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Barcelona fought back from two goals down at newly-promoted Levante to win 3-2 on Saturday, while Atletico Madrid dropped more points from a winning position. First-half goals by Ivan Romero and Jose Luis Morales gave Levante a shock lead against the champions in Valencia, before Pedri and Ferran Torres struck twice in quick succession after half-time to level the match. Hansi Flick's side looked destined for a draw on a near-waterlogged pitch until an Unai Elgezabal own-goal in injury time gave them a second win to start the new season. \"They made it very difficult for us, we have to improve a lot,\" Flick told his post-match press conference. Levante went ahead on 15 minutes when the ball was knocked across the Barcelona box to Romero, who bamboozled Pau Cubarsi with a superb shoulder-drop before rifling past new signing Joan Garcia. Torres looked certain to level in the 37th minute when Pedri's deft first-time pass found the forward unmarked in the box, but his fierce strike rattled the bar rather than the net. After Lamine Yamal lost the ball on the edge of the Levante box, the hosts broke and as Roger Brugue prepared to shoot Alejandro Balde appeared from nowhere to save his side with an excellent piece of last-ditch defending. However, as Balde got back to his feet another shot was fired at him which the referee decided struck the 21-year-old's arm in an unnatural position following a VAR intervention. Morales, 38, duly doubled Levante's lead from 12 yards seven minutes into first-half added time. Stung by the decision, Barcelona came out roaring in the second half. Midfield metronome Pedri took matters into his own hand four minutes after the interval as he powered a 25-yard drive into the top corner to spark the comeback. \"They always tell me to shoot and look, in the first half I had a shot like a kid and in the second half I was able to score,\" the 22-year-old told Movistar. Flick's side were back level three minutes later when Torres made amends for his earlier miss with a close-range finish from a corner. Raphinha forced a great sprawling save from Pablo Campos on 83 minutes after his shot was diverted goalwards by a defender. But Levante's luck failed to hold as Yamal floated in a cross from the right in the 91st minute which Elgezabal glanced into his own net under pressure from Torres. - Atletico woes - Diego Simeone's Atletico are still without a win this season after they drew 1-1 with promoted Elche, leaving them on one point after two frustrating outings. Just like in their 2-1 loss at Espanyol last weekend, Atletico went ahead in the first period at the Metropolitano on Saturday. \"We wanted to win, we deserved to win the match,\" said Diego Simeone. \"From the Espanyol match to today's match, there was improvement. They played better. The result is not there but we need to work, be patient.\" Alexander Sorloth raced onto David Hancko's perfectly-weighted ball into the left channel, before slotting past the advancing goalkeeper on eight minutes. But Rafa Mir got Elche back on level terms on the quarter-hour with a crisp finish at the end of a lighting counter-attack. Giuliano Simeone came within a whisker of restoring Atletico's lead shortly before the interval only for his arrowed shot to glance off the post, however a goal would have been disallowed after Sorloth was flagged off-side in the build-up. Conor Gallagher had a half-chance to grab Atletico's second in the 79th minute when he intercepted Matias Dituro's errant clearance near the halfway line, only for his long-range half-volley to bounce wide of the unguarded goal. The best chance then fell to Marcos Llorente moments afterwards as he poked a snap-shot inches wide of the far post. Diego Simeone was booked deep in stoppage time for his frustrated reaction to a penalty not being given following a tussle in the box as Atletico endured yet more frustration. Earlier, Mallorca and Celta Vigo shared the spoils when Mateu Morey's late leveller for the home side cancelled out Javi Rueda's first-half opener. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "title": "Sinner, Sabalenka chasing rare repeats as US Open gets underway",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Defending champions Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are chasing rare repeat US Open triumphs as the final Grand Slam of the season gets under way in New York on Sunday. Women's world number one Sabalenka opens the defense of her 2024 crown on the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center's Arthur Ashe Stadium showcourt against unseeded Swiss player Rebeka Masarova in one of the highlights of the opening day of the singles, which is being held on a Sunday for the first time in history. Italy's world number one Sinner, meanwhile, begins his bid for back-to-back titles on Monday, when he takes on unseeded Czech Vit Kopriva. Both Sabalenka and Sinner are attempting to become the first players to successfully defend their titles for more than a decade. No woman has repeated at the US Open since Serena Williams won the last of a hat-trick of titles in 2014 following wins in 2013 and 2012. On the men's side, it has been 17 long years since a succesful title defense, with Roger Federer's 2008 victory capping a remarkable run of five straight championships. Sabalenka believes difficulty in repeating is part of the challenge of Flushing Meadows fortnight, where everything is noisier, flashier and simply bigger than other Grand Slams. \"I think it's a lot of pressure, definitely,\" the Belarusian said. \"Just because this place is so big, and it feels bigger than the other slams in some ways. \"Maybe every time defending champions comes and they put so much pressure on themselves. But I feel like I'm experienced enough to just focus on myself and try to replicate that result.\" Asked for her thoughts on the fact that the last 11 US Open titles have been split by 10 players, Sabalenka quipped: \"My thought is to change it.\" - 'Very difficult' - Sinner echoed Sabalenka's comments, attributing the difficulty of repeating in New York to a combination of factors -- season-ending fatigue, scheduling of games and size. \"We are heading towards the end of the season, so some players, they are tired,\" Sinner said. \"It's also the last big trophy of the year. Things can change... I don't know what's gonna happen this time. But of course it's a very, very difficult tournament to play.\" Sinner and Sabalenka are the top seeds in a field that will be rewarded with a record $90 million purse, making the US Open the richest tournament in the world. The men's and women's singles champions will receive $5 million each. The biggest threat to Sinner's hopes of defending his title is likely to come from Spain's second seed Carlos Alcaraz. The 22-year-old, winner of the US Open in 2022, has already faced Sinner twice in Grand Slam finals this season, winning a five-set classic in the French Open in June before losing to the Italian in the Wimbledon final last month. \"Every time we face against each other on court, we raise the level to the top,\" Alcaraz said on Saturday as he prepared to face unseeded American Reilly Opelka in the first round on Monday. The men's draw will also see former world number one Novak Djokovic take another tilt at winning a record 25th Grand Slam. Djokovic, 38, has not played since reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon last month, where he was comprehensively beaten by Sinner. Back in the women's draw, Sabalenka will be wary of threat posed by second seed Iga Swiatek, who warmed up for New York with victory at the Cincinnati Open, which in turn followed a breakthroug win at Wimbledon. Swiatek opens her campaign on Monday against Colombia's Emiliana Arango. Monday's first round games could also see a possible US Open farewell for Venus Williams. The 45-year-old tennis icon was given a wild card into the main draw after recently returning to tennis from a 16-month absence. \"Super thrilling to be back,\" Williams said on Saturday ahead of what will be a record-extending 25th US Open appearance. \"It does not get old; it just gets more exciting.\" তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit On Friday, chief selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu achieved what many of his predecessors couldn't do – announce a Bangladesh squad for a tournament without much uproar. The Bangladesh team selection committee named a 16-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup, scheduled to be staged at the UAE from September 9. The same squad will also compete in the three-match T20I series against Netherlands at home, starting on August 30. A key reason behind this mellow response was perhaps that the selectors didn't deviate much from the squads that won them bilateral T20 series over Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Only two changes were made from the Bangladesh squad which beat Pakistan 2-1 at home last month –wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan Sohan and batter Saif Hassan came in at the expense of all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz and opener Mohammad Naim. The omissions of Miraz and Naim wasn't a surprise as both players failed to cement their places despite getting several opportunities in recent months. Miraz, who had opted out of the Netherlands series due to family reasons, had featured in five of Bangladesh's last nine T20Is, making mere 64 runs and taking only four wickets. Meanwhile, Naim, who returned to the side in the Sri Lanka series in July after three years, could not replicate his domestic dominance, making only 45 runs in three matches. Their poor performances prompted the selectors to bring in Sohan and Saif after a long hiatus even though both of them have not been consistent in this format in recent times. When asked to explain their inclusions, the chief selector told reporters at Mirpur yesterday, \"We had extensive discussions about Sohan during the Sri Lanka tour. At that time, we thought and realised that given our team's formation, his chances of making the playing XI were very slim. \"What we felt then was that if he played in the Global Super League as preparation—since we knew he would also be playing for the 'A' team in Darwin—it would serve as additional preparation… Facing such big challenges before joining the Asia Cup squad was important. \"In Saif's case, if there's a gap in the top or middle-order—let's say if Tawhid Hridoy gets injured—we believe he can cover both positions,\" he added. When it came to talking about the Tigers' chances of winning the upcoming show-piece event, Lipu gave a realist answer. \"Emotionally, I'm also hopeful that the team will go there with the target of becoming champions. But when you think analytically and logically, you have to consider where you actually stand and what kind of challenges lie ahead. \"There is always a chance to qualify for the final as we have played in the Asia Cup final thrice. But I think we need to think step by step.\" তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "title": "De Bruyne strikes in Napoli's strong start to Scudetto defence",
    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Kevin De Bruyne scored on his Napoli debut on Saturday as the Serie A champions kicked off their title defence with a straightforward 2-0 win at promoted Sassuolo. The headline signing of the summer transfer window in Italy, De Bruyne opened his account for Napoli in the 57th minute when his free-kick swept in from the left flank and evaded everyone before nestling in the far corner. De Bruyne made sure Napoli would get off to a winning start to the new season in Reggio Emilia after Scott McTominay continued where he left off from last season with a bullet header in the 17th minute. McTominay was the star of Napoli's second Scudetto triumph in three years with 12 goals and again looked in fine form for Antonio Conte's team. The Scotland midfielder was unlucky not to double his tally for the evening on the stroke of half-time when his rasping first-time effort crashed onto the crossbar. Napoli have never retained a league title, not even when Diego Maradona strutted his stuff in southern Italy back in the 1980s, and their attempt to do so after the historic success of 2023 ended with a 10th-place finish. However unlike Luciano Spalletti, whose exit straight after winning the league destabilised Napoli, Conte has decided to stay put and that has given fans hopes of another big season. The current team will have to play the first few months of Napoli's bid for a fifth league crown without Romelu Lukaku. De Bruyne's Belgium teammate could be out of action until the end of the year with a thigh muscle tear and his understudy Lorenzo Lucca struggled to get into the game on his Napoli debut. Sassuolo romped to the Serie B title last term but were outclassed on their return to the top flight, and finished the match with 10 men after debutant Ismael Kone was sent off in the 79th minute for two bookable offences. Later, Luka Modric will start AC Milan's first fixture of the campaign against promoted Cremonese as the veteran star begins a new chapter in northern Italy after 13 trophy-laden years at Real Madrid. Roma face an old foe in their first official fixture under new coach Gian Piero Gasperini, with former Lazio striker Ciro Immobile making his Bologna debut. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

Victory came at a cost for Mikel Arteta as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard hobbled off injured just eight days before Arsenal's trip to Liverpool. Arsenal edged ahead of north London rivals Tottenham at the top of the table on goal difference, as the only two sides so far with a 100 percent record from their opening two games. Saka fired in a blistering strike from a narrow angle to double the home side's lead after Jurrien Timber opened the scoring. Gyokeres was signed from Sporting Lisbon as the solution to Arsenal's need for a killer number nine. The Swede's ability to succeed in the Premier League has been questioned despite his prolific record of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting. Gyokeres made his mark with a fine individual run and finish before Timber bundled in his second from another Declan Rice corner. Gyokeres rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot with virtually the last kick of the game. A day of celebration for the home fans began before kick-off when new £60 million ($81 million) signing Eberechi Ezi was paraded after he turned down a move to Tottenham. But the sight of captain Odegaard and talisman Saka leaving the field soured a routine win. Arsenal had to rely on their threat from set-pieces to grind out a 1-0 win at Manchester United on the opening weekend of the season. Despite a dominant start to the game, that was how the the Leeds defence was prized open. Timber had scored just twice in 52 Arsenal appearances before Saturday. The Dutch international doubled that tally as he firstly got his head to Rice's inviting delivery on 34 minutes. Odegaard then made his departure after appearing to injure his shoulder falling heavily to the turf. Saka soon had the Emirates crowd back on their feet when he drilled Timber's pass high past Lucas Perri with his supposedly weaker right foot. Gyokeres had at one point been a target for Leeds during his days with Coventry in the Championship before making the move to Portugal. Arsenal's new £66 million signing showed the Yorkshire side what they missed as he scampered onto Riccardo Calafiori's ball over the top and cut inside before firing in at the near post. Saka missed nearly four months of last season with a hamstring injury. Worryingly for Arteta, the England international was holding the back of his left leg when he was replaced on 53 minutes. Arsenal added a fouth when Leeds failed to clear another Rice corner and Timber forced the ball over the line from close range. Arteta could then afford the luxury of handing a Premier League debut to 15-year-old Max Dowman. He became the second youngest ever player to play in the English top-flight after team-mate Ethan Nwaneri. Dowman's trickery won a penalty deep into stoppage time that Gyokeres gratefully dispatched. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",

    "content": "Pakistan should deal with issue of 1971 to advance ties: NCP Pakistan foreign minister meets BNP, NCP, Jamaat delegations Autopsy of Bibhuranjan  finds no  injury marks Pakistan foreign minister arrives in Dhaka for official visit Arsenal have completed the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace, it was announced Saturday, with the England international returning to his boyhood club. No fee was disclosed but Eze has signed a four-year contract in a deal that could be worth up to £68 million ($92 million) after Arsenal scuppered Eze's proposed move to their arch north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. \"We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal,\" said Gunners manager Mikel Arteta. \"He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today. \"His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.\" Eze becomes Arsenal's seventh signing of a summer transfer window where they have now spent some £250 million following the arrivals of Viktor Gyokeres, Cristhian Mosquera, Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard and Noni Madueke. Arsenal have finished second in the Premier League for each of the past three seasons and last won a trophy five years ago. But Eze's signing is a further indication of their determination to end a 22-year wait for the Premier League title. Arsenal's move -– for a reported initial fee of £60 million prior to performance related add-ons –- sees Eze returning to his boyhood club, with the 27-year-old having started his career at the Gunners' academy before being released. His signing was announced shortly before Arsenal's first Premier League home game of the season, against Leeds, on Saturday. Eze arrives at the Emirates assured of a place in Palace history after scoring the winning goal in the Eagles' FA Cup final victory against Manchester City in May to secure the south London club's first major trophy. তিনি বলেন, বাংলাদেশের মানুষ আবার গুণ্ডাতন্ত্রের দিকে যেতে চায় না।",
