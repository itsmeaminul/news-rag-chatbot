    "content": "The National Executive Council of Prothom Alo Bondhushava and the Khulna University Journalists’ Association (KUJA) jointly organised a day-long workshop on skills development at Khulna University. The event, titled “Smart Skills”, was supported by mobile brand Honor Bangladesh and facilitated by Khulna Bondhushava. The workshop covered a wide range of contemporary themes, including leadership, communication, personal branding, career development, artificial intelligence, debating, and presentation skills. Participants included members of Bondhushava from Khulna, Satkhira, Jashore, Bagerhat, Mongla and Koyra, alongside more than 200 Khulna University students. The programme was inaugurated around 10:15 am on Saturday at the Liaquat Ali Auditorium of Khulna University, commencing with the national anthem. Jafar Sadiq, President of the National Executive Council of Bondhushava, presided over the opening session. He emphasised that along with nurturing young talents, it is equally important to ensure their effective expression. He remarked that the initiative was designed to help university students acquire and practise essential skills relevant to the present era. In his welcome address, Prothom Alo’s Khulna correspondent Uttam Mondal underlined the significance of such training. Speaking as a special guest, Khulna University’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Md Harunur Rashid Khan said, “To lead, one must first learn. Even today, many graduates struggle to write a proper CV or establish effective communication when applying for scholarships abroad. Beyond bookish knowledge, we must learn practical skills. AI technologies are often misused; hence, young people must learn how to employ them responsibly. There is no alternative to training. I believe the knowledge and insights gained today will benefit participants throughout their lives.” Professor Md Nazmus Sadat, Director of Student Affairs at Khulna University, stressed that graduation should not merely be about acquiring a certificate. It should prepare students for the state, society, and the world at large. “We must equip ourselves according to contemporary demands, not only with a national but also a global sense of responsibility,” he added. Abdullah Al Mamun, Head of Business at Honor Bangladesh, praised Bondhushava’s initiatives, saying, “This workshop is relevant for people across all sectors. Our thanks to Bondhushava, Prothom Alo, and Khulna University for making this possible.” Other speakers included Farhad Hossain Mallik, General Secretary of the Bondhushava National Executive Council; Alqama Romin, President of Khubisas; and MM Masum Billah, Vice-President of Khulna Bondhushava. Training sessions were conducted by former and current Bondhushava National Council Presidents Uttam Roy and Jafar Sadiq on leadership and communication. Brand communication professional Shamsuddoha Safayet delivered a session on personal branding (Define, Design, Deliver). Mohammad Ali Firoz, Head of Programmes at Bdjobs Limited, discussed Campus to Career. Abdullah Al Mamun of Honor Bangladesh conducted a session on AI for Youth, while Md Faruq Rahman, the company’s Head of Marketing, led a special quiz on Honor Bangladesh. Winners included Sanjida Urmi, Ashish Mondal, Mrityunjay Kumar Biswas, Rashed Ahmed, Nilima Barman, Kamal, Shafayet, Hamim, Kartik Kirtunia, and Imon. The closing session was attended by Hasan Mahmud Saki, Assistant Director of Student Affairs at Khulna University.",

    "title": "‘If I knew my father died, at least I could have offered prayers for him’",
    "content": "More than 300 individuals remain missing, with little prospect of return. The investigation commission is pursuing the list of Bangladeshi detainees in Indian prisons. During the previous Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s 15 and a half years in office, the word “disappearance” became synonymous with terror. State forces were deployed to abduct political opponents, critics and dissenting voices at various times. While the bodies of some were later recovered, many remain untraced. According to figures provided by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, at least 300 people are still missing. The commission considers the likelihood of their safe return extremely limited. Thus, countless loved ones have been reduced to little more than a statistic in the tally of disappearances, leaving families in unending anticipation. Nearly 12 years ago, on 27 November 2013, Md Saiful Islam (Hiru), President of the BNP’s Laksam Upazila unit and former Member of Parliament, along with Md Humayun Kabir (Parvez), President of Laksam Pourashava BNP, were forcibly disappeared. Humayun Kabir’s son, Shahriar Ratul, told Prothom Alo on Friday, “I still do not want to accept that my father is gone. Yet, if Allah has not granted him life, had I known he was no longer alive, at least I could have consoled my heart. I could have gone to the place where his remains lie, offered two rakats of prayer and recited supplications for my father.” It is against this backdrop that, 30 August, the International Day of the Victims of disappearances is being observed. On 29 August last year, Bangladesh signed the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Two days earlier of 2024, on 27 August, the present interim government established a commission to investigate cases of enforced disappearance involving law enforcement agencies. The practice of enforced disappearance as a political tool began in 2010 under Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian rule, primarily targeting opposition party leaders, activists and dissenters. Ahead of the one-sided election of 5 January 2014, disappearances occurred on a large scale. Yet, the then Awami League government consistently denied such incidents, instead offering demeaning claims that victims had either “gone into hiding” or “fled due to creditors.” The Commission of Inquiry states that enforced disappearances under the Awami League regime generally led to four possible outcomes. Victims were abducted and killed, with their bodies concealed; falsely shown as arrested under the Anti-Terrorism Act; sent across the border to India to be detained by Indian law enforcement; or in a small number of cases, shown as arrested under fabricated charges. Sources affirm that after the fall of the Awami League government, a number of detainees were released from secret detention centres. For those who have still not returned, it is now certain they are no longer in custody, with the majority believed to have been killed. On 17 April 2012, BNP’s then Organising Secretary Elias Ali and his driver Ansar Ali were forcibly disappeared from Banani, Dhaka. Speaking to Prothom Alo on Friday, his wife, Tahsina Rushdir (Luna), said, “We still have no knowledge of his fate. The commission is investigating and has informed us that a special unit was involved. This makes their work extremely difficult. I demand a fair trial. I want to know the truth.” The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has reported four measures undertaken to trace missing persons. First, police have been provided with a list of missing individuals and instructed to locate them. Two, based on specific information, the commission is conducting searches in different areas. Third, the list of Bangladeshi detainees in Indian prisons is being cross-checked against the list of missing persons. Fourth, efforts are being made to determine whether any of those being “pushed in” across the border from neighbouring countries are among the missing. The police have now begun to pursue legal action in disappearance cases during the (now-banned) Awami League regime where no cases or legal proceedings were initiated at the time. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Baharul Alam told Prothom Alo, “Many people were disappeared during the tenure of the previous government, but no cases were filed then. Now, abduction cases are being registered. The Commission on Disappearances has referred 160 such cases, which have been sent to the relevant police stations for necessary action.” According to commission sources, they have so far obtained a list of 996 Bangladeshi detainees in Indian prisons. None of the missing persons are on this list. The commission is now awaiting a second list. The commission has also received approximately 1,850 complaints of enforced disappearance. As some complaints were lodged through multiple channels, duplicates were removed, leaving more than 1,700 verified cases. Furthermore, during the investigati",

    "title": "RUCSU election: Female candidate running for VP",
    "content": "In RUCSU’s 63-year history, elections have been held 14 times so far. A review of the winners’ list shows that no woman has ever been elected to either the VP or the General Secretary (GS) post. A female student is set to contest for the position of vice-president (VP) in the Rajshahi University Central Students’ Union (RUCSU) elections. Her name is Tasin Khan, a student of the 2020–21 academic session at the Institute of Education and Research, and former coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement. In RUCSU’s 63-year history, elections have been held 14 times so far. A review of the winners’ list shows that no woman has ever been elected to either the VP or the General Secretary (GS) post. When contacted about whether any woman had ever contested for the post of VP, Ragib Ahsan, who served as RUCSU VP for the term 1988–89, told Prothom Alo that to his knowledge, no woman had ever run for the VP post. Rajshahi University was established in 1953, and RUCSU was formed in 1962. The last RUCSU election was held in 1989. That year, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed (now a BNP leader) was elected VP, while Ruhul Quddus (JASAD Chhatra League leader) became GS. The upcoming RUCSU polls are scheduled for 25 September. Distribution of nomination forms began on 24 August and will end on 31 August. According to the RUCSU Election Commission, around 200 nomination forms have been distributed so far for the RUCSU and the Senate elections. But, the commission could not confirm the exact number of form sold for RUCSU election alone. So far, no panel has been announced by the political student organisation or general students for the elections. However, many individuals have already declared their candidacy and begun campaigning. Female candidates, however, remain very few. Former Anti-Discrimination Student Movement coordinator Tasin Khan collected her nomination form on 26 August. Speaking to Prothom Alo on Friday evening at the university’s Transport Market, she said she would contest the VP post from a panel, though she did not provide further details. Tasin explained that after the July uprising, she had returned to normal life. Although she had opportunities to join political parties, she chose not to. Seeing the RUCSU election taking on a political shape prompted her decision to run, as she believes it is crucial to prevent student union elections from being dominated by politics. She said, “If we vacate the field, then it really will turn political. That’s why I decided to contest, to represent the general students.” Highlighting that despite putting in efforts female students are not being interested to contest in the election, Tasin added, “There are many female students who are good at debating and literature. I’ve tried for hours to convince them to run, but I couldn’t. They truly believe this is a political platform.” When asked about the reasons, Tasin pointed to the major risk of cyber-bullying faced by female candidates. She criticised the administration for taking no visible steps in this regard. She also expressed concern about the low number of women contesting and uncertainty over how much of the women’s vote would be cast. The number of female candidates contesting in RUCSU will only be clear after the nomination submission deadline is over. According to the revised schedule, nomination papers can be submitted from 1–4 September, with the final candidate list to be published on 11 September. The final RUCSU voter list includes 25,092 voters. Of them 15,351 are male students and 9,741 are female students, meaning women account for 39 per cent of the electorate. Professor Shahed Zaman of the Chemistry Department at Rajshahi University, who was a student during the 1989 RUSCU elections, told Prothom Alo that in the past, three to four panels typically contested, each with several female candidates. This time, however, very few candidates have come forward. He said that over the past 15 and a half years of one-sided politics, female students have grown disinterested, and now their reluctance has deepened with the added fear of cyber-bullying.",

    "content": "Bangladesh's export earnings from the US market could increase by over USD 2 billion in the 2025-26 fiscal year due to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the United States on China and India. Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office made this projection while speaking at a discussion titled \"Macroeconomic Challenges and a Way Forward\" at the Economic Reporters Forum (ERF) auditorium in Paltan on Saturday (30 August). The event was organised by the ERF as part of the Moazzem Hossain Memorial Lecture. Moazzem Hossain is the late editor of the English daily The Financial Express and the founding president of the ERF. Bangladesh is now in a suitable position after settling tariff talks with the US, and the export sector will boom gradually, Zahid opined. Though the economy got stabilised, the situation at the household level has deteriorated, with poverty and inequality on the rise, he said. According to Zahid, the restored economic stability is primarily due to the removal of those responsible for previous instability. \"Money laundering from the country has stopped, resulting in a significant decline in hundi and an increase in foreign currency inflows,\" he said. Meanwhile, looting within the banking sector has halted. Yet, the true condition of banks has not improved, as defaulted loans continue to rise, he pointed out. He also highlighted the impact of international developments favourable to Bangladesh's economy, particularly the notable decline in the value of the US dollar. Addressing the role of policy, Zahid asserted that policy has not contributed significantly to the current stability. \"However, there has been a shift in economic management, with greater discipline introduced in policymaking. Still, this does not imply that all government decisions are correct.\"",

    "title": "Sreeradha Datta in Dhaka: ‘Bangladesh and India need genuine candid dialogue’",
    "content": "Sreeradha Dutta delivered a keynote lecture titled ‘The Political Impact of Bangladesh–India Relations: From the Liberation War to the July Uprising’ at the Bengal Delta Conference in Dhaka. India and Bangladesh must begin genuine and candid dialogue if their bilateral ties are to experience a revival, said Professor Sreeradha Datta of the Jindal School of International Affairs, O.P. Jindal Global University. She argued that relations between Dhaka and New Delhi are now in “sleep mode” not because of Bangladesh, but because India has yet to fully understand how its national interests will be safeguarded in the post-Sheikh Hasina period. In her view, in the past 50 years the two neighbours have never truly engaged in an open conversation. Sreeradha Datta made the remarks yesterday, Friday, in a keynote address at the Bengal Delta Conference 2025, held at a hotel in Dhaka. Her lecture was titled “Political Impacts of Bangladesh–India Relations: From the Liberation War to the July Uprising” and lasted about 15 minutes. The session did not include a Q&A with the audience. The two-day international conference has been organised by the Dhaka Institute of Research and Analytics (DAIRA) under the theme: “Bangladesh at Crossroads: Rethinking Politics, Economics, Geopolitical Strategy.” At the outset of her speech, Sreeradha Datta described the present Dhaka–Delhi relationship as being in “sleep mode”. She noted that India is unlikely to take any major steps for now and is waiting for Bangladesh’s next election. Reflecting on the past year, she observed that both in India and Bangladesh the media had spread significant amounts of misinformation. “In these past months, I have sensed a deep-seated hostility towards India in Bangladesh,” she said, adding that within India too there is equal scepticism about Bangladesh’s interim government, its new political order, and emerging parties. “There is a sense of mutual animosity on both sides,” she remarked, adding, “and I don’t think this requires much elaboration.” According to her, if India and Bangladesh are serious about reviving their relationship, they must begin “a genuine candid dialogue – something that has never happened in the last 50 years.” She stressed, “We always say, ‘What do you want?’ or ‘What do I want?’ But never, ‘What can we do together for our mutual benefit?’” Calling Bangladesh “an extremely important neighbour” for India, she emphasised, “If there is one country we can place our highest trust in, it is Bangladesh. I firmly believe that in this region, much can be achieved if India and Bangladesh work together. But that will only be possible if both countries speak openly and sincerely with each other – which has happened very rarely between the two neighbours.” Professor Sreeradha Datta added, “I know our problems, just as I know yours. But I believe there is no problem that the two countries cannot solve by sitting together. India has worked very closely with Sheikh Hasina, and I understand the resentment and hostility that has grown around her and the Awami League.” “But Delhi’s closeness with the Awami League was a reality, and it is only natural that such intimacy would produce side effects,” she pointed out.",

    "title": "Political culture has to be changed",
    "content": "Political culture of Bangladesh has to be changed and politics should be more open. Youth and greater section of people would not allow the old political culture to continue. The demoncratic institutions must be strengthened for sake of the future of the country. Experts made these remarks in the inaugural session of ‘Bengal Delta Conference 2025’ held in a city hotel yesterday, Friday. Dhaka Institute of Research and Analytics (DAIRA) organised the two-day international conference. The speakers further said Bangladesh expressed an aspiration for paradigm shift in governance after July mass uprising. They also warned that the tendencies of centralising power, perpetuating inequality, and exploiting religion for political purposes could undermine all progress. The two-day conference is being held under the theme “Bangladesh at Crossroads: Rethinking Politics, Economics, Geopolitical Strategy.” The opening session began in the morning with the national anthem. A one-minute silence was observed in memory of the martyrs of July. Afterwards, the organisers screened a documentary on the July Uprising and the overall situation in Bangladesh. On the first day of the conference, five working sessions took place along with several keynote addresses and special sessions. Delivering the keynote address at the inaugural session, Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that Bangladesh must bring change to its political culture, and a new definition of political culture must be set. At the same time, institutions of Bangladesh must be strengthened. Politics should not only be about the desire to come to power but about nation-building, institution-building, improving education, and fostering opportunities for the younger generation. Touhid Hossain further said the youth who initiated this change will not allow the country to return to the pre-2024 political reality. “Perhaps they (the youth) cannot implement it right now, because politics is still in the hands of our generation—those who are clinging to power. But they will not last long. The youth may make mistakes, but they have vitality and a willingness to learn. They will gain experience—maybe through difficult paths—but they will learn, and we will see change.” In his welcome remarks, Professor Mushtaq Khan, economist at SOAS University of London, said that the July Uprising, led by mass participation, brought about change in Bangladesh, and among the organisations created in its aftermath is DAIRA, the conference organiser. He noted that one year after the uprising, many express frustration—some with political parties, some with the interim government’s achievements, some with law and order, others with the reform process, and some with the trial of perpetrators. Yet Mushtaq Khan emphasised the achievements of 2024. He said it’s true that there are frustrations but he wanted to stress Bangladesh’s enormous achievement in 2024. An uprising led by unarmed people toppled one of the most violent, repressive, bloodthirsty governments in the region. Bangladesh is a country that has repeatedly ousted autocratic regimes through new movements. He added that the fascist state structures have not changed, which is a matter of concern and disappointment for many citizens and students. But he expressed optimism that Bangladesh’s politicians now understand that returning to the old political arrangement is impossible—people will not accept it. While the old power structures have not been dismantled, they cannot be sustained through mere reconfiguration. This is because such structures cannot ensure employment, health, or education. People will not compromise with their current demands. Politics, he said, must become more open. It is not only about amending parts of the constitution, but about examining where parties get their funding, to whom they are accountable, and how power structures are built. Mahfuz Anam, Editor and Publisher of The Daily Star, said, “Bangladeshis dream big, but we have failed at institution-building. We use democracy to gain power, but once in power, we begin to destroy democracy. Sadly, that is the history of Bangladesh.” “No matter how good a democratic framework you build, if its practitioners do not believe in democracy, it is bound to fail. Unless political parties internalise tolerance, dialogue, and a culture of working together, democracy cannot survive. For the future of Bangladesh, there is no alternative to strengthening democratic institutions.” Siddharth Varadarajan, founding Editor of The Wire (India), said Bangladesh should build a framework of empowerment and accountability that enables people to come to power and holds them accountable. Most important, he stressed, is to create political structures and culture that prevent institutions from being hijacked, corrupted, or destroyed, as seen even in established democracies. Siddharth Varadarajan also said politics in Bangladesh, as in many other countries, has often been based on ine",

    "content": "Pace spearhead Taskin Ahmed's four-wicket haul was complemented by captain Liton Das's half-century as Bangladesh thrashed Netherlands by eight wickets in the three-match T20 International series opening game today at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. Taskin claimed 4-28 to help Bangladesh hold back Netherlands to just 136-8, a total that the hosts comfortably overhaul by reaching 138-2 in only 13.3 overs. Liton Das hammered an unbeaten 29 ball-54, his 13th T20 fifty, equaling  Shakib Al Hasan as the most fifty by a Bangladeshi batter in this format to  lead the charge. Following his return to the national team after four years, Saif Hasan shined in with both batting and bowling. He snapped 2-18 with the bowling and then followed it up with 19 ball-36 not out to play a second fiddle to Liton Das. To make it more memorable, he clubbed consecutive sixes to sign off the game in befitting fashion. Liton and Saif combined for a 46 off 26 for the undefeated third wicket stand to sail the side home and take 1-0 lead in the series. Opener Parvez Hossain Emon scored 15 runs in the first over to give Bangladesh a fluent start in chasing. However, he was dismissed in the third over, without adding any runs to his 15. His fellow opener Tanzid Hasan Tamim scored 29 and added 66-run with Liton for the second wicket to edge the side closer to the victory before Tim Pringle had Tanzid caught by Max O'Dowd at long on. That mattered little as Saif gave Liton ably support in sealing the deal quite comfortably. Earlier Taskin's third four-wicket haul and second against Netherlands since his 4-25 in Hobart during 2022 T20 World Cup, broke the spine of the Netherlands. Saif Hasan also bowled impeccably to make the matter worse for the visitors. Mustafizur Rahman picked up just one but strangled Netherlands batters with tight line and length that saw him conceded just 19 runs in four overs. But after being put into bat first, Netherlands made a fluent start, thanks to opener Max O'Dowd who went after Bangladesh bowlers in aggressive fashion. Taskin Ahmed provided the breakthrough, dismissing O'Dowd after he made 15 ball-23 with three fours and one six. He followed it up with the wicket of another opener Vikramjit Singh, ending his painstaking stay in the crease. Saif Hasan struck twice in his first over, getting rid of captain Scott Edwards (12) and Teja Nidmanuru who top-scored for Netherlands with 26. Those two blows left Netherlands to 68-4 in 10th over. Netherlands batters could never recover from that collapse as they lost wickets at regular interval. The second match is on Monday at the same venue.",

Police have since been deployed to the scene. Witnesses said a group of demonstrators hurled bricks and stones at the party headquarters before torching part of the ground floor around 6:00 pm. Police used water cannons and baton charges to disperse the attackers, eventually extinguishing the fire. Witnesses also reported repeated chases between the demonstrators and police during the incident. The attackers smashed a portrait of JaPa founder HM Ershad that had been displayed at the front of the building. By 7:15 pm, police had brought the situation under control. A heavy deployment of law enforcement remained in place, while JaPa leaders and activists gathered outside the office. The incident follows violent clashes in the same area on Friday between activists of JaPa and the Gono Odhikar Parishad. Several people, including Gono Odhikar Parishad president Nurul Haque Nur, were injured after police intervened with baton charges.",

    "title": "Branding July Uprising a conspiracy serves India’s interests: Siddharth Varadarajan",
    "content": "Portraying Bangladesh’s July Uprising as a “conspiracy” was advantageous for the Indian government, as it helped deflect attention from its own foreign policy failures and controversies, Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of the Indian media outlet The Wire, said on Friday. He pointed out that in the first week of the uprising, the Indian government deliberately remained silent, allowing rumours to spread unchecked. Siddharth Varadarajan delivered his remarks at the inaugural session of the two-day international conference, Bengal Delta Conference 2025, held at a Dhaka hotel yesterday. Research institute, Dhaka Institute of Research and Analytics (DIRA) organised the conference. Its central theme was “Bangladesh at Crossroads: Rethinking Politics, Economics, Geopolitical Strategy.” Speaking at a special panel titled “Media, Rumour and Narrative: Post-July Bangladesh in the South Asian Frame”, Varadarajan commented on Bangladesh–India relations before and after the uprising, the rumours circulated across Indian social media, the positioning of Indian mainstream media, and incidents of violence against Hindus. He was joined in discussion by Bangladeshi documentary filmmaker Dipak Kumar Goswami. Siddharth Varadarajan observed that successive Indian governments had nurtured the assumption that it would be best for India if Sheikh Hasina remains the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. From the tenure of Manmohan Singh through to that of Narendra Modi, Indian policymakers felt comfortable with Sheikh Hasina in power and sought to ensure her continued survival in office. According to him, the Modi government regarded Sheikh Hasina as India’s most reliable partner. In return, she extended economic benefits to industrialists close to Narendra Modi, such as the Adani Group. Simultaneously, Modi turned a blind eye to the instrumentalisation of Bangladesh in India’s domestic politics. Reflecting on the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government, Siddharth Varadarajan noted that during the first 24 hours, the scenes emerging from Bangladesh were dominated by the celebratory mood surrounding Sheikh Hasina’s downfall, alongside reports of child killings and student killings. Yet, after the first 24 hours, Indian media began reporting that large-scale communal riots were under way, that Hindus were under attack, temples were being vandalised, and even that genocide was occurring. To this end, fake footage was disseminated, and artificial intelligence was deployed. He stated that the Indian government intentionally permitted such rumours to proliferate. According to Siddharth Varadarajan, the rumours spread to such an extent that they entered the mainstream media. Casting the July Uprising as an “anti-Hindu conspiracy” carried an overtly political message. Some claimed it was orchestrated by Pakistan, others attributed it to the United States “deep state”, while yet others blamed Jamaat-e-Islami. Thus, not only did this narrative obscure the failures of the Modi government’s foreign policy, it also deepened divisions within Indian society itself. Varadarajan concluded that, overall, the Indian government was content with this framing, for it shifted public attention away from the failures of Modi’s foreign policy.",

    "title": "A group is plotting to foil the election: Mirza Fakhrul",
    "content": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has alleged that a certain group is conspiring to derail the forthcoming national election. “It is with deep regret that I must say today—there is an ongoing conspiracy in this country. A clique is attempting to thwart the election that lies ahead. An extremist faction is trying to divide people by invoking different forms of extremism,” he said. Mirza Fakhrul made the remarks at the first national convention of the Nationalist Ethnic Minority Groups, held at the Town Hall in Mymensingh city Saturday afternoon. Members of ethnic minority communities from the plainland began arriving at the Town Hall’s Tareque Memorial Auditorium in the morning. Representatives of 18 ethnic minority communities—including Garo, Hajong, Manipuri, Banai, Barman, Khasi, Koch, Hadi and Tripura—from 12 districts across the country took part in the meeting. Addressing the event as special guest, the BNP secretary general said, “It is our collective duty—just as in 1971, when Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, smaller nations and larger ones fought together for our territory, independence, sovereignty and rights—that we now work together once again. We firmly believe that under the leadership of our leader Tareque Rahman, as he has repeatedly said to you, we can move towards that goal by uniting all communities. The dreams you hold will be realised in a new Bangladesh under Tareque Rahman’s leadership—a Bangladesh where the rights of all will be ensured.” Pointing to the opportunity that has arisen through the recent uprising, Mirza Fakhrul added, “We are united on one principle—that every citizen’s rights must be guaranteed in building this new Bangladesh. Today, some of you may feel you are members of separate ethnic minority groups. But Begum Khaleda Zia and Tareque Rahman have always said—this must never be stated. We are not a majority or a minority; we are all Bangladeshis. Our rights are equal.” The platform Nationalist Ethnic Minority Groups formally began its journey in 2007, and received recognition and approval from the BNP on 7 September 2014. This was the first time its national representative assembly has been held. BNP acting chairman Tareque Rahman joined the programme virtually and delivered a speech at 3:30 pm.",

Therefore, with regard to the demand for banning the party, appropriate action would be taken after examining the legal aspects.

    "title": "‘Complete Shutdown’ continues at BUET, students announce graffiti programme today",
    "content": "Students at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) are observing a “complete shutdown” for the second consecutive day today, Saturday, to press home their three-point demand. The demonstrating students have announced to hold a graffiti campaign on campus in the afternoon. All classes and examinations at BUET have been suspended. Earlier on Thursday, the Engineering Rights Movement announced a “complete shutdown” at all engineering universities. During a visit to several departments at BUET around 10:00 am today, Saturday, no students were seen attending. However, some teachers and administrative staff were present. Masud Rana, a security guard at the Mechanical Engineering Building, said, “Exams have been cancelled. No students have come.” A few students were seen moving around campus individually. One student, who requested anonymity, said he had come for urgent research-related work. An official from the BUET Vice-Chancellor’s office told Prothom Alo that although classes and exams remain suspended, administrative activities are continuing. BUET student Abrar Faiyaz told Prothom Alo this morning, “In protest against the police attack on BUET students, and as part of our ongoing programme, we will hold a graffiti campaign on campus this afternoon.” The Engineering Rights Movement platform had announced the “complete shutdown” at a press conference on Wednesday night. According to the announcement, BUET and all engineering universities across the country are to observe the shutdown. The students’ three-point demand includes: recruitment to the grade-9 assistant engineer post only through examination, with BSc in Engineering as the minimum qualification; allowing higher-degree holders to apply for grade-10 posts, which are currently restricted to diploma holders; and, ensuring that only those who have completed a BSc in Engineering are permitted to use the professional title “Engineer.” The government has already formed a committee to examine the legitimacy of the demands of BSc engineering graduates and diploma degree holders and to prepare recommendations. On Tuesday afternoon, BUET students began a sit-in at Shahbagh intersection to press home their demands. The following day, around 11:00 am, they blocked the Shahbagh intersection as part of their pre-declared programme. At around 1:30 pm, when the students attempted to march towards the Chief Adviser’s official residence, Jamuna, police stopped them near the InterContinental Hotel. At that time, police used sound grenades, tear gas shells, water cannons and batons to disperse the protesters. Many students were injured in the clashes.",

    "title": "Interim govt strongly condemns attack on Nur, pledges probe",
    "content": "The nation’s prayers and solidarity remain with Nur, injured members of his party and their families during this critical time, the statement said. The interim government has strongly condemned the brutal attack on Nurul Haque Nur, the president of Gono Odhikar Parishad and a prominent leader of the July Uprising, on Friday. “Such acts of violence are an assault not only on Mr. Nur but also on the spirit of the democratic movement that brought the nation together in its historic struggle for justice and accountability,” said a statement issued by the government today, Saturday, that termed Nur as a tireless advocate of democracy, justice, and the rights of the people. It said the interim government assured the people of Bangladesh that a thorough and impartial investigation into this heinous incident will be conducted with utmost urgency. “No individual, regardless of influence or position, will be spared from accountability. Justice will be delivered transparently and swiftly,” the statement read. In the immediate term, a specialised medical board has been formed to oversee the treatment of Nur and other injured members of his party, it said, adding, “The Government is committed to ensuring that they receive the highest standard of medical care. Should their conditions require it, they will be flown abroad for advanced treatment at state expense”. The nation’s prayers and solidarity remain with Nur, injured members of his party and their families during this critical time, the statement said. “Mr. Nurul Haque Nur played a historic role during the 2018 anti-quota protests against the fascist regime of Sheikh Hasina. As a student leader, he mobilised the youth, uniting diverse voices and standing fearlessly against injustice,” it added. “Nur was arrested and brutally tortured in custody during the July Uprising when his role symbolised the collective aspiration of our people for a free, fair, and democratic Bangladesh,” the statement said, adding that his courage and sacrifices would forever remain part of “our nation’s history”. “At this moment, the Interim Government calls for unity among all political and social forces that took part in the July Uprising. This unity is essential to protect the gains of our struggle, to resist all conspiracies against the people’s mandate, and to ensure our successful transition to democracy,” it read. In the statement, the interim government reaffirmed in the strongest possible terms that the national election will be held on time, in the first half of February 2026. “This is the solemn commitment of the Interim Government to the people of Bangladesh. All conspiracies, obstructions, or attempts to delay or derail the election will be firmly resisted by the Interim Government and our democracy-loving patriotic people,” the statement said. “The people’s will shall prevail, and no evil force will be allowed to undermine our march to democracy,” it added.",

    "title": "Rashed Khan demands resignation of Home Adviser",
    "content": "Gono Odhikar Parishad General Secretary Rashed Khan has demanded the resignation of the interim government’s Home Affairs Adviser Lieutenant General (retd.) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury. “You have no right to remain in this post. We demand your resignation. If you have any sense of shame, you should apologise and step down,” Rashed Khan said on Saturday afternoon. He talked to the media after visiting Gono Odhikar Parishad President and former DUCSU (Dhaka University Central Students’ Union) Vice-President Nurul Haque at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. He further said, “Whether you take responsibility or not, we believe you have failed to control the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh. After yesterday’s incident, there is no way you can continue in this position.” Referring to a viral video on social media, Rashed Khan said the man in the red shirt had no connection with the attack on Nurul Haque. “It was some rogue elements within the army who assaulted Nurul Haque. The man in the red shirt attacked Samrat, a central leader of Chhatra Odhikar Parishad,” he alleged. He also accused both the army and the police of involvement in the assault. “The army is involved in the attack on us, and the police played their part too. On whose orders did the army take to the streets and leave us bloodied? The Army Chief must investigate and take action against those responsible.” Clashes broke out between activists of the Jatiya Party (JaPa) and Gono Odhikar Parishad in the capital’s Kakrail area on Friday evening. The violence erupted when a procession by Gono Odhikar Parishad was passing in front of the JaPa’s office. Law enforcement later used batons, injuring Nurul Haque and several others. According to the Gono Odhikar Parishad, JaPa men first attacked their procession, while JaPa claimed it was the Gono Odhikar Parishad activists who attacked them. Later that night, at around 9:30 pm, Gono Odhikar Parishad leaders were preparing for a press conference in front of their office to protest the attack when police and army personnel assaulted them, Rashed Khan told Prothom Alo around 10:30 pm. He alleged that more than 100 of their leaders and activists were injured, including President Nurul Haque. Six were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, including Nurul Haque, who was critically injured. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in a statement on Friday, said law enforcement had been forced to use force to maintain public safety. ISPR added that five army personnel were also injured in the incident. Brigadier General Md Asaduzzaman, Director of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, said a high-level medical board has been formed for Nurul Haque’s treatment. “He has head injuries, and his nasal bone has been fractured, which caused heavy bleeding. The bleeding has now stopped, and he has regained consciousness. However, it will take at least 48 hours to determine whether he is out of danger,” he added.",

Bayern's back line looked vulnerable, just as it had in Wednesday's German Cup first-round win over third-tier Wehen Wiesbaden in which they conceded two goals and needed a stoppage-time winner to advance. \"We know what we have to work on,\" Bayern coach Vincent Kompany said. \"It is true that we could have decided the game earlier today if we had scored five goals from the chances we created. The most important thing is that we are creating lots of chances. \"The second half was not solid,\" Kompany said. \"But we have won all our games. We have scored a lot of goals but in some moments we have to be calm. But we have to put things in perspective. We had a short pre-season.\" While the fans' focus was on the pitch, Bayern bosses were trying to untangle a stalled loan deal for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, but Kompany said he knew nothing about the situation. Bayern, who have led the Bundesliga since the third matchday last season, have now earned two wins from two league matches with nine goals scored. They were in command from the start but had to wait until the 28th minute to take the lead through Serge Gnabry's powerful header from a Harry Kane cross. They scored again on the stroke of halftime through Luis Diaz' second league goal of the season. Bayern looked to have put the game to bed when France international Michael Olise made it 3-0 three minutes after the restart. But Augsburg pulled a goal back in the 53rd minute through Kristijan Jakic before Mert Komur struck again 14 minutes from time. Augsburg's Robin Fellhauer was taken off on a stretcher in stoppage time after clashing with Bayern's Sacha Boey. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

The Argentine international, 21, has signed a seven-year deal with the world champions. Garnacho was in attendance at Stamford Bridge to watch the Blues go top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Fulham on Saturday. \"It's an incredible moment for my family and I to join this great club. I can't wait to get started,\" said Garnacho. \"I watched the Club World Cup and to join the world champions is special – we're the best team in the world! It's amazing to be here and I'm very happy.\" Garnacho scored 26 times in 144 appearances for United, including in the Red Devils 2-1 FA Cup final win over Manchester City in 2024. However, he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford and had been part of a small group, also including Antony and Jadon Sancho, excluded from first team training with the rest of the squad this season. Garnacho's arrival takes Chelsea's spending in this window beyond £250 million. Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens have also added to Enzo Maresca's attacking options. However, a hamstring injury suffered by Delap against Fulham could scupper Nicolas Jackson's departure on loan to Bayern Munich. The Senegal international was set to join the Bundesliga champions, but Chelsea have reportedly ordered Jackson to return to London with Pedro their only fit option at centre forward. \"When you have two strikers, it's enough. When one of them is injured for different weeks, probably it's not enough,\" said Maresca after suggesting he expects Delap to miss six to eight weeks. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Looking to quickly forget their humiliating League Cup exit at fourth-tier Grimsby, United started well in front of an expectant Old Trafford crowd, the dominant hosts taking a deserved lead through a Josh Cullen own goal in the 27th minute. United's wastefulness in front of goal proved costly, however, as Burnley levelled early in the second half through Lyle Foster, only for Bryan Mbeumo to restore the home side's less than two minutes later. Another goalkeeping error by Altay Bayindirallowed Jaidon Anthony to draw Burnley level in the 67th minute before Fernandes stepped up to convert from the spot after VAR had noticed a foul on Amad Diallo to save United's blushes. \"It is three points, if you look at the game we should solve it in the first half but we are fighting to the last minute because of things we over complicate,\" United manager Ruben Amorim said. \"Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score. You feel you can control the game. But one throw-in, one set piece. I shook my head, because sometimes football is like this.\" Even so early in the season, United were facing a mini-crisis ahead of Burnley's visit, having failed to win either of their opening two league matches before the embarrassing loss to Grimsby. Ruben Amorim said in his programme notes, totalling a meagre 95 words, that he was a manager not best pleased with how things are going less than a year into the job. In last season's campaign to forget, United's home form was damaging. STRONG START But the hosts, who had lost eight of their previous 13 league games at Old Trafford, started strongly against Burnley. Mbeumo twice went close inside the first 15 minutes, before United were awarded a penalty for a foul on Mason Mount, only for VAR to overturn the decision. The pressure paid off, however, when Casemiro's header came back off the crossbar before going in off Cullen. Amad should have made it two in first-half stoppage time, before substitute Joshua Zirkzee, who replaced the injured Matheus Cunha, missed another golden chance. The nerves set in after the break, as Foster was left all alone from Jacob Bruun Larsen's cross to level, only for Diogo Dalot to pick out new signing Mbeumo who netted his first league goal for United. Bayindir, at fault for Arsenal's winner on the opening day of the campaign, then failed to deal with another set piece, parrying the ball out to Anthony who made no mistake from close range. Big-money signing Benjamin Sesko was summoned from the bench, but the Slovenia striker was equally wasteful. It appeared Old Trafford was set for more disappointment before VAR intervened, giving Fernandes the chance to make amends for his penalty miss at Fulham last week. The skipper sent the ball into the bottom corner to spark wild celebrations, more out of relief than joy ahead of the international break. \"We now have two weeks with a lot of opportunities. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do,\" Amorim said. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

In the process, Litton equalled Shakib Al Hasan's record for the most T20I fifties for Bangladesh, matching the ace all-rounder with his 13th half-century in the format. The right-hander was in full flow from the start, bringing up his fifty in just 26 balls before finishing unbeaten on 54 off 29 deliveries, an innings laced with six boundaries and two sixes which helped Bangladesh chase down a 137-run target in only 13.3 overs. It was Litton's first fifty against the Netherlands in four outings, surpassing his previous combined tally of 54 runs against the Dutch. So far, Litton has scored T20I half-centuries against eight different opponents -- Afghanistan (2), England (1), India (1), Ireland (1), Pakistan (1), Sri Lanka (1), West Indies (2), and Zimbabwe (3) -- with Zimbabwe being the most frequent victim. The 30-year-old now has 2,346 runs in the format, sitting third on Bangladesh's all-time run chart behind Shakib (2,551) and Mahmudullah Riyad (2,444).

    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail She was never solely confined to the yellowing pages of a poetry anthology. Ever since its publication, Banalata Sen stepped out from Jibanananda Das's verses to claim her place in every Bengali's heart. Her presence now lingers beyond the quiet gatherings of literature enthusiasts, and lives in the imagination of lovers and dreamers. In the 1990s, sarees first began to be treated as artists' canvases, where poetry and calligraphy were fused to create magic in wearable form. At first, the idea was novel. However, over the years, the concept took root and soon became the perfect garb for soirees, literary gatherings, and poetry recitals. Gradually, visual poetry, woven and painted onto fabric, began to step into more glamorous arenas. No saree exhibition or fashion runway today feels complete without these bold, contemporary style statements. In the latest design of Afsana Ferdousi, the immortal words of Banalata Sen find an unexpected new canvas: the folds of wedding couture. Ferdousi is celebrated for blending sustainability with a seamless fusion of modernity and tradition, and has reimagined Banalata Sen on the six-yard drape. This time, at the special request of a bride-to-be. In the poem, Jibanananda Das uses the image of a weary, long-travelled sailor as a central metaphor. The narrator describes himself as having wandered through the seas for \"a thousand years,\" crossing ancient oceans and lands — from the \"darkness of Ceylon\" to \"the seas of Malaya\" — before finding peace in the quiet gaze of Banalata Sen. In Ferdousi's hands, the saree's zamin and anchal become the sailor's final destination. The central motif of the poem is brought to life as the wanderer's quest meets the artist's muse. Alongside her painted figure, fragments of Jibanananda Das's verse flow across the fabric. With its hand-painted anchal, flowing calligraphy, and meticulous detailing, Ferdousi's creation elevates the bridal saree into a work of art. The bridal wear is a testament to the designer's ability to blend heritage with contemporary designs, crafting a piece that speaks as much of personal style as it does of timeless tradition.

    "title": "Design that respects nature: Inside Albion Art Gallery",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail The plot was nothing special; a patch of sandy ground in front of a tired 90s building in Uttara. A garage, a storage room, a 4x4 bathroom, and some plants left to fend for themselves. Two half-dead trees — one jackfruit, one neem — stood quietly at the edge of being forgotten. But for architect S M Ehsan Uz Zaman, it wasn't just a leftover site. It was memory, erosion, resistance — and eventually, the foundation for what he calls \"The Story of a Tree.\" He convinced his client to work around the land, not over it. And that's how the Albion Art Gallery came to be — not as a sleek intervention, but as a story about not erasing what was already there. Zaman's client, Mahmood Ullah, had a clear ask; an outdoor coffee bar with seating, an exhibition space inside the old garage, and rooftop dining. Trees and ground cover were viewed as obstacles. But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed. That one decision meant giving up a few seats in the café plan. But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design. If anything, he's sceptical of how loosely the word is used. \"I don't think this project is a showcase for green architecture,\" he says. \"But maybe it starts a conversation.\" He's critical of how the industry handles ecology. \"As architects, we say we care. But we keep letting trees fall. We put a few planters on balconies and call it sustainability. We cool our buildings with air conditioning instead of shade.\" Zaman's firm, Ehsan Uz Zaman and Associates, takes on all kinds of work — residential, public, and private. But he's most drawn to commercial spaces like cafes and galleries, where design can shape behaviour and not just aesthetics. Asked if he'd host student workshops or open the space up for learning, he's unsure. \"I don't know if this project qualifies as an example,\" he says. \"But maybe it's enough to get people asking better questions.\" Albion Art Gallery isn't perfect. It isn't cutting-edge. And that's the point. It's a quiet project. One where a counter got smaller so a tree could live. One where an architect didn't try to impress anyone — he just refused to erase what was already there. Zaman didn't build for the portfolio. He built for the space. That's the story. And that's enough.

Cunha, 26, who arrived in Manchester this summer from Wolves, was taken off in the 28th minute of the Red Devils' 3-2 win at Old Trafford. Brazil coach Carlo Ancelotti responded by calling up winger Samuel Lino, who joined Brazilian club Flamengo from Atletico Madrid in July. Cunha is the fourth player from Ancelotti's initial squad announced on Monday to be ruled out through injury, following Joelinton  of Newcastle, Alex Sandro of Flamengo and Vanderson of Monaco. After a tricky start to their campaign, Brazil are third in the 10-team South American group and have ensured qualification for next year's World Cup. In the last two rounds they will face Chile, the only team already eliminated, at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on September 4, before travelling to Bolivia, who could also be eliminated by then, five days later, at altitude in El Alto. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Chasing 137, Litton led from the front, bringing up his fifty off just 26 deliveries. The right-hander struck six fours and two sixes in an unbeaten 29-ball 54, stitching together an unbroken 46-run stand with Saif Hassan. Saif provided the finishing touches with a 19-ball 36, which included three maximums and a four, as Bangladesh wrapped up the chase in just 13.3 overs. Earlier, Taskin starred with the ball, returning figures of 4-28 to restrict the Netherlands to 136 for eight. The pacer removed both openers -- Max O'Dowd (23 off 15) and Vikramjit Singh (4 off 11) -- inside the first eight overs to put the brakes on the scoring. He then struck twice at the death, claiming his third four-wicket haul in T20Is and second against the Dutch, having earlier achieved the feat against Ireland. Part-time off-spinner Saif chipped in with two wickets (for 18 runs), including the key wickets of skipper Scott Edwards (12 off 7) and Teja Nidamanuru (26 off 26) in the 10th over, ensuring Bangladesh remained in control throughout. While seven Dutch batters reached double figures, none managed to cross 30, with Nidamanuru top-scoring. Taskin four-fer restricts Netherlands to 136-8 Bangladesh pacer Taskin Ahmed picked up four wickets to help restrict Netherlands to 136-8 in the first T20I of the three-match series at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Taskin dismissed both Dutch openers -- Max O'Dowd (23 runs off 15 balls) and Vikramjit Singh (4 off 11) -- within the first eight overs to keep their scoring rate in check and scalped two more at the death to ensure the visitors don't amass a considerable total. It was the 30-year-old's third four-fer in the format and second against the Netherlands, with another coming against Ireland. Taskin impressed amongst the frontline bowlers and had help from part-time option Saif Hassan (2-18) who used his gentle off-spin to great effect -- removing skipper Scott Edwards (12 runs off seven balls) and Teja Nidamanuru (26 runs off 26 balls) in the 10th over -- which helped the Tigers maintain control throughout the innings. Seven Dutch batters reached double figures but none of them could cross 30, with the inning highest being scored by Nidamanuru. Taskin strikes twice as Netherlands struggle Bangladesh pacer Taskin Ahmed struck twice and part-timer Saif Hassan scalped as many to reduce the Netherlands to 68-4 after 10 overs in the first T20I of the three-match series  at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. Taskin dismissed both Dutch openers -- Max O'Dowd (23 runs off 15 balls) and Vikramjit Singh (4 off 11) -- within the first eight overs to keep their scoring rate in check. The visitors managed to amass just 34 runs for the loss of one wicket in the Powerplay. Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards, who looked good for his seven-ball 12, was dismissed when Saif came to bowl his first over -- the 10th over of the innings. After a drinks break, with two ball remaining to end  the over, set batter Teja Nidamanuru threw his wicket away following a run-a-ball 26. Tigers to field first Bangladesh skipper Litton Das won the toss and opted to field in the first T20I of the three-match series against the Netherlands at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. The Tigers' starting eleven feature five changes from their last T20I match, played against Pakistan, with batter Saif Hassan making the cut after having played five T20Is since making debut in 2021. Bangladesh have won four and lost only once against the Netherlands in the format -- two of those victories came by a slim margin of eight and nine runs.

As per the updated timings, the matches will now begin at 6:30pm local time (8:30pm Bangladesh time) instead of the previously scheduled 6:00pm local time (8:00pm Bangladesh time). The only match timing that has remained unchanged is the clash between hosts UAE and Oman on September 15, which will begin at 4:00pm local time (6:00pm Bangladesh time). The timings were changed to mitigate the effects of excessive heat on the players, said ECB officials in a press conference. According to the updated schedule, all of Bangladesh's matches will begin at 8:30pm. The Tigers, who are slotted in Group B, will first face Hong Kong on September 11, then Sri Lanka on the 13th and Afghanistan on the 16th.

Cremonese will be top of Serie A overnight after Romano Floriani Mussolini won the penalty which Manuel De Luca converted for his side's third goal, giving Davide Nicola's team a perfect six points from their opening two league fixtures of the season. Floriani Mussolini replaced Alessio Zerbin on the right wing in the 82nd minute at the Stadio Giovanni Zini and made an impact with a bright display before being brought down by Alieu Fadera in stoppage time. De Luca's penalty saved Cremonese's blushes as Sassuolo had come back from two goals down at half time thanks to an Andrea Pinamonte strike and Domenico Berardi's spot-kick which was won by Fadera. \"Too many things happened in too little time, I don't think I'll ever forget tonight because I've always dreamed of making my debut in Serie A,\" said Floriani Mussolini, who has the name \"Romano\" on his shirt. \"My goal was to make a difference and I'm happy that I managed to do that.\" Floriani Mussolini is the son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former Italian and European MP and the granddaughter of the fascist dictator who ruled Italy from 1922 to 1943. The 22-year-old, who has said in the past that he has no interest in politics, is on loan at Cremonese from Lazio, where he came through the youth ranks after previously playing for local rivals Roma. Last season he played in Serie B for Juve Stabia, where some fans celebrated his first and only goal for the club by doing fascist salutes and shouting his surname. Floriani Mussolini could soon have Jamie Vardy as a teammate as the former Leicester City striker and Premier League winner is in talks to join the promoted team as a free agent. - Milan back on track - Cremonese lead AC Milan and five other teams by three points after the seven-time European champions won a tough match at Lecce 2-0 to get their season up and running. Milan fell to their first ever defeat to Cremonese at the san Siro last weekend but bounced back at the Stadio Via del Mare thanks to goals in the second half from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic. \"You can't just expect to win because you're wearing the Milan jersey. Tonight the team played with humilty, respect for the opposition and above all great care and attention,\" said coach Massimiliano Allegri. Allegri also effectively confirmed that Christopher Nkunku has completed his move to Milan from Chelsea, referring to the France international as \"the new boy\" whose arrival should be announced officially on Saturday. Loftus-Cheek opened the scoring in the 66th minute when the England international got a glancing header to Luka Modric's floated free-kick. His first goal of the season finally broke the deadlock for Milan who had a goal chalked off in each half following VAR checks. First Matteo Gabbia was denied the opening goal in the sixth minute when he was spotted pushing Lassana Coulibaly in the back before thumping home a header. And Santiago Gimenez, who has been subject to speculation that he is set to be offloaded, was caught just offside as he collected Alexis Saelemaekers' pass and rolled past Wladimiro Falcone. But Loftus-Cheek put Milan ahead and Pulisic sealed the points for Milan with four minutes remaining when he pounced on sloppy play at the back by Lecce, burst clean through on goal and stroked home. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

The 21-year-old winger's relationship with United manager Ruben Amorim soured when he was left out of the starting line-up for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May. Garnacho cast doubt on his future at Old Trafford in a post-match interview and his brother Robert posted on Instagram that the Argentine had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Amorim. While on holiday in June, Garnacho posted a photograph of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt with \"Rashford\" on the back, an undisguised endorsement of team-mate Marcus Rashford's decision to leave United, drawing an angry backlash from fans. Maresca has long made known his disdain for social media, but said his hands are too full to spend time policing his players' online activity. \"I'm not going to tell them don't use social media,\" he said. \"They have family around them that can give them advice. \"I have four kids and I try to give them advice, but if I need to give 25 more players advice it's too complicated. \"Anyone can do what they want, anyone can say what they want. But at the end it's a matter of respect.\" Maresca has already faced questions in the early weeks of the season relating to his players' online behaviour after defender Wesley Fofana removed all reference to Chelsea from his Instagram after he was left on the bench for the goalless draw with Crystal Palace on the opening weekend. The 24-year-old's agent has since said the page was undergoing changes courtesy of someone in his team and the player was not responsible. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Stunned by United's humiliating League Cup second round loss at fourth tier Grimsby on Wednesday, Amorim said \"something has to change\" at the club and he would \"think things through\" during next week's international break. Amorim's outburst led to questions over his future at Old Trafford, with United winless in their first two Premier League games this term. The Portuguese coach was already battling to change perceptions of his reign, which only started in November, after United suffered their worst league finish since 1973-74 last season. But ahead of Saturday's visit from Burnley, Amorim explained his comments were made in the heat of the moment on a hugely frustrating night. When asked if he would still be in the job when United visit Manchester City on September 14, Amorim said: \"I don't know what is going to happen. That is my idea, but I'm not going to promise you nothing, what is going to be in the future. \"But I'm the manager of Manchester United, and I think that is not going to change.\" Amorim responded to a question about his confidence in his ability to take United forward by simply saying: \"Yes.\" With a laugh, he added: \"It depends on the day. But I'm confident because I saw these players play really well in tough matches. And I see it in training. That training is so much better. \"I was not surprised, I was shocked in the last game, shocked. This game was not our team, the way we are doing things. So I'm always confident in the way I manage the team.\" জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

In fact, it has become the norm for the record 15-time winners of the competition. However, in the upcoming edition of the Champions League, Xabi Alonso's men will need to set a different type of record just to play one fixture. Real Madrid will have to travel the furthest any European club has ever gone in Champions League history for an away game, as they need to cover a staggering 6,411 km (3,984 miles) to face Kazakhstan's FC Kairat Almaty in the league phase of the new-format tournament. While this will be a one-of-a-kind experience for Kairat Almaty -- who are set to become only the second club from Kazakhstan to appear in the Champions League after FC Astana in 2015/16 -- it will be a gruelling journey for Kylian Mbappe and Co. There are no direct flights from Madrid to Almaty. Including transit time, Real Madrid will need to make a 12-hour journey to reach Kazakhstan's largest city. However, it is Kairat Almaty who will set the ultimate travel record in the tournament's history when they visit Lisbon to face Sporting CP of Portugal. That trip will span nearly 6,900 km -- the longest distance ever undertaken by a team in Champions League history. To play that match, Kairat Almaty will spend almost a full day on a plane, as both the outbound and return flights exceed 12 hours. Logistical planning will also be a major challenge for UEFA. Alongside Sporting CP and Real Madrid, Kairat Almaty will also face Arsenal, Inter Milan, Olympiacos, and Copenhagen, making some of the longest trips in their historic Champions League debut. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly in",

The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

    "title": "Electricity crisis may worsen",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendation",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy.

The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

    "title": "South Asia least integrated after Africa",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail Regional cooperation in South Asia remains in a precarious state, largely due to political decisions that often override economic logic, foreign policy experts said yesterday. Despite widespread poverty and the looming threat of climate change, South Asia is the least integrated region in the world outside sub-Saharan Africa, they noted, urging honest conversations to improve people's lives. The observations came on the final day of the two-day Bengal Delta Conference, organised by Dacca Institute of Research and Analytics (DAIRA) at the InterContinental Dhaka. \"SAARC is largely dormant, hampered by India-Pakistan tensions, contested borders, and fragile economies,\" said Michael Kugelman, senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, during a panel discussion as part of the conference. Kugelman said Bangladesh is well-positioned to contribute to regionalism because of its flexible foreign policy, reflected in its 2023 Indo-Pacific Outlook which echoed both US and Chinese priorities. Bangladesh also maintains strong ties with China, Japan, the EU, Russia, the UK, and multilateral lenders. However, he pointed out Dhaka's limitations -- narrow export base, low FDI, a constrained private sector, strained ties with India, and the Myanmar crisis -- all of which restrict its regional agency. \"During the previous government there was a unique type of relationship that in many ways constrained Bangladesh's agency… I think there's an opportunity now that hopefully you can capitalise on,\" he added. Prof Mushtaq Khan of SOAS University of London said India's internal politics often spill into its relationship with Bangladesh. \"India is trying to throw out its own Muslims into Bangladesh, saying they are Bangladeshi,\" he said Stressing that connectivity cannot advance without trust, he said, \"Maybe we should stop talking about roads and rail and transport networks until we solve the fundamental problem about people.\" He noted a shift in Bangladesh's outlook from treating India as its dominant partner to seeking balance through engagement with ASEAN, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, the US, and China. Prof Sreeradha Datta of OP Jindal Global University endorsed Prof Mushtaq's views. \"The government of India is constantly talking about its own national interest. But what about Bangladesh's national interest? Threat perception works both ways, and I don't think India has fully recognised that,\" she said. She added that Bangladesh's disrupted connectivity with Nepal illustrated how politics, not economics, drives decisions. \"These were essentially politically motivated rather than profit motivated,\" she said, calling for a reset of relations across South Asia, though she admitted such change was unlikely soon. Dr Amena Mohsin, former professor of international relations at Dhaka University, said connectivity in the region is largely reduced to infrastructure, not connectivity of minds. \"For me, if you want to have a South Asia, that South Asianness has to be there -- the meeting of people's minds where you can identify yourself as a South Asian.\" Jahangirnagar University Prof Shahab Enam Khan, who moderated the discussion, said the very idea of market and private sector-driven resources is being exploited through political preferences, whether it is saffron, rightism, or nationalism. \"While regionalism remains constrained, the path forward lies in recognising micro-level issues, strengthening people-to-people ties, and depoliticising trade and connectivity.\" জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280. Turnover at the CSE stood at Tk 13.61 crore yesterday, down from Tk 19.5 crore the previous day. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

Party offices in several other districts were also vandalised. Speaking to The Daily Star, JP Joint Secretary General Khandaker Delowar Jalali, said the Kakrail incident occurred shortly after party leaders and activists had concluded a scheduled programme and left the office premises. \"A group of 20 to 30 individuals defied police barricades and launched the arson attack on the party headquarters. \"Police responded with truncheons, water cannons, and sound grenades to disperse the attackers and bring the fire under control.\" \"The fire damaged books from the ground-floor library, important documents, and furniture.\" Delowar claimed the attack was carried out by men from Gono Odhikar Parishad. \"They labelled the Jatiya Party as a collaborator of the deposed Awami League and demanded that the government ban the party.\" Masud Alam, deputy commissioner, Ramna Division, DMP, told The Daily Star that agitators threw brickbats at the JP office last night. \"Police, however, dispersed them and controlled the situation.\" Earlier in the day, another group attempted multiple attacks on the Uttara residence of JP Chairman GM Quader. They also staged a demonstration and burned an effigy of Quader in front of his house in Uttara's Sector 7. As there was tight security there since morning, the police successfully resisted the attackers and secured the area. On Friday night, leaders and activists of Jatiya Party and Gono Odhikar clashed in front of the former's central office in the capital's Kakrail. At least six people, including Gono Odhikar Chairman Nurul Haque Nur and General Secretary Rashed Khan, were hospitalised as members of police and army charged truncheons on them to control the situation. Following the incident, attacks started taking place at JP offices in various districts, including Tangail, Thakurgaon, Khulna and Rajshahi. Party sources claimed the attackers were from Gono Odhikar Parishad. In Tangail, the JP office near Sadar Police Station was vandalised around 11:30am yesterday. The attackers later blocked the Dhaka-Tangail highway at Nagar Jalfai for about half an hour, leaving vehicles stranded on both sides. Locals said after holding a brief rally, protesting the attack on Gono Odhikar Chairman Nur, they left the area, allowing traffic to resume. \"Additional police have been deployed in the area,\" said Tanvir Ahmed, officer-in-charge of Tangail Sadar Police Station. In Thakurgaon, JP's Haripur upazila unit office was vandalised yesterday afternoon. The agitators also torched office furniture while chanting slogans against JP and its leaders, witnesses said. Earlier, Gono Odhikar men brought out a procession from the Battali area in the upazila headquarters and paraded different streets. When the procession reached the JP office, the activists began vandalising it, witnesses also said. On information, police rushed to the spot, but the attackers had fled before their arrival, said Haripur Police OC Jakaria Mandal. No one was injured in the incident, the OC said, adding that additional police have been deployed in the area to avoid further untoward incidents. In Khulna city, at least 20 people were injured after police charged truncheons in front of the JP district and city office at Dakbangla intersection yesterday afternoon. According to police and witnesses, a procession of 50 to 60 men from Gono Odhikar marched towards the JP office from Shibari intersection. Witnesses said the demonstrators tried to break the gates and hurled bricks. At that time, police intervened, charging truncheons and dispersing the protesters. Sadar Police OC Haoladar Sanwar Hossain said, \"Activists of Gono Odhikar tried to create disorder in front of the JP office. Police dispersed them immediately. The situation is now under control.\" In Rajshahi city, JP office in the Gonokpara area was vandalised around 12:00am.

    "title": "Evacuation of Gaza City ‘undignified, risky’",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail The Red Cross yesterday warned that any Israeli efforts to evacuate Gaza City would put residents at risk, as Israel's military tightened its siege on the area ahead of a major planned offensive. After nearly 23 months of devastating war, Israel is under increasing pressure to end its offensive in Gaza, where the United Nations has declared a famine and the majority of the population has been displaced at least once. But despite the calls at home and abroad for an end to the war, the Israeli army is readying itself for an intensified operation to seize the Palestinian territory's largest urban centre and relocate its inhabitants. \"It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,\" International Committee of the Red Cross President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement. The dire state of shelter, healthcare and nutrition in Gaza meant evacuation was \"not only unfeasible but incomprehensible under the present circumstances\". An Israeli military statement on Friday declared Gaza City a \"dangerous combat zone\", adding that daily pauses in fighting intended to allow limited food deliveries would no longer continue. The military did not call for the population to leave immediately, but a day earlier COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, said it was undertaking preparations \"for moving the population southward for their protection\". A journalist working for AFP on the northern edge of Gaza City reported he had been ordered to evacuate by the army, adding conditions had become increasingly difficult, with bombardments coming closer to his position and gunfire and explosions heard nearby. The UN estimates that nearly a million people currently live in Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City and its surroundings. The territory's civil defence agency reported intense Israeli strikes in Gaza City's Sabra and Zeitoun districts, and an \"escalation\" in the Sheikh Radwan area north of the city centre. On Friday, Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, warned that there were \"nearly one million people between the city and the northern governorate who basically have nowhere to go, have no resources even to move\". On Friday, the United States said it would not allow Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to travel to New York next month for a United Nations gathering of world leaders, where several US allies are set to recognise Palestine as a state. A State Department official said Abbas and about 80 other Palestinians would be affected by the decision to deny and revoke visas from members of the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization and the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. Several European foreign ministers arriving at a European Union meeting in Copenhagen yesterday criticised the US decision. Abbas had planned to attend the annual high-level UN General Assembly in Manhattan. He was also set to attend a summit there, where Britain, France, Australia and Canada have pledged to formally recognise a Palestinian state. Abbas' office said it was astonished by the visa decision and said it violated the UN \"headquarters agreement\". Under a 1947 UN \"headquarters agreement\", the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. However, Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the UN would discuss the visa issue with the State Department. Since October 7, 2022, Israel's offensive has killed at least 63,025 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the UN considers reliable. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

But on August 9, that dream was dashed forever. For the son of slain cobbler Ruplal Robidas, of Ghonirampur Dangapara village in Rangpur's Taraganj upazila, education has become a luxury -- the struggle now is simply to survive. Along with his father, 14-year-old Joy Robidas lost his childhood too. A ninth-grader at Taraganj Government Model High School, he has now taken up his late father's profession. On Friday morning, Joy was seen sitting on the small wooden stool, the same one his father once sat on, in Taraganj bazar, repairing shoes with his tools neatly arranged beside him. \"I open the shop at 10:00am and work till 4:00pm. I earn Tk 280 in a day,\" he said, his voice trembling. \"I learned how to mend and polish shoes, but I don't know how to make new ones yet. I'll learn that too. From now, I must work every day to earn for my family.\" As he spoke, his eyes welled up. \"I used to dream of studying and becoming an established person. But after my father was beaten to death, everything collapsed. He was the only breadwinner. Now I must feed my grandmother, mother, and two sisters. I don't know if I'll be able to continue my education, but I want to make sure my sisters can.\" On the night of August 9, Ruplal, 48, and his nephew-in-law Pradip Lal, 47, were returning home on a battery-run van. When they reached Burirhat Bottala in Sayar union, some locals stopped them, suspecting they were van thieves. Within minutes, a mob formed and beat them to death.\nThe following day, Ruplal's widow Malati Rani Robidas filed a murder case with Taraganj Police against 700 unnamed persons.

    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail The government has pledged a judicial inquiry into the attack on Gono Odhikar Parishad President Nurul Haque Nur. Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam made the announcement while speaking to reporters on the premises of State Guest House Jamuna,  the CA's official residence, yesterday. Nur and five others suffered critical injuries after being beaten by police and army personnel in front of their office at the capital's Bijoy Nagar on Friday evening. The assault followed clashes between Gono Odhikar Parishad and Jatiya Party activists near the latter's Kakrail office. Until the filing of this report around 11:00am, Nur remained in intensive care at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Shafiqul said Nur would receive all necessary treatment; he would be sent abroad if required. Others injured will also be given the best possible medical care, he added. Earlier in the morning, in a statement issued by the Chief Adviser's Press Wing, the government strongly condemned the assault on Nur, calling it \"an attack on the democratic spirit of the July uprising\" and on \"the nation's struggle for justice and accountability\". It promised a \"thorough and impartial investigation\" to ensure that no individual, regardless of position or influence, escapes accountability. \"Justice will be delivered transparently and swiftly,\" it said, while urging unity among political and social forces to safeguard democratic gains. Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus spoke with Nur over the phone, assuring him of full government support. He enquired about his treatment and also conveyed sympathy to Nur's family and urged them to remain strong, the press wing said. Doctors said Nur suffered a head injury, jaw and nose fractures, and minor internal bleeding. His face and eyes remain swollen with blood accumulation. The former Ducsu VP was brought to the emergency ward around 11:20pm Friday and later shifted to the ICU, said Dr Mostak Ahmed, a resident surgeon at DMCH. A medical board comprising specialists from neurosurgery, ENT, ophthalmology, and casualty departments has been formed. \"We do not think he needs surgery at the moment, but he is still not out of danger,\" Dr Mostak said. The attack on Nur set off widespread condemnation and protests throughout the country. Gono Odhikar Parishad activists yesterday rallied in the capital's Bijoy Nagar, placing three demands: banning the Jatiya Party within 48 hours, forming a committee immediately to investigate the attack, and the resignation of the home affairs adviser. \"We want justice,\" said General Secretary Rashed Khan. In Rajshahi, a section of Rajshahi University students blocked the Dhaka–Rajshahi highway for nearly an hour from 11:30am, joined by around 50 students from different departments. The rally was addressed by Fahim Reza, former coordinator of Students Against Discrimination, and Al Shahriar Shuvo, general secretary of the Student Rights Council. In Chattogram, protesters blocked Soloshohor Gate No. 2 from noon to 2:00pm, chanting slogans and setting tyres ablaze, halting traffic for nearly two hours. In Tangail, demonstrators vandalised the Jatiya Party office near the police station before blocking the Dhaka–Tangail highway for about half an hour. \"The situation is now calm, and additional police have been deployed,\" said Tanvir Ahmed, OC of Tangail Sadar Police Station. In Munshiganj, 30-35 protesters blocked the Dhaka–Mawa Expressway for 15 minutes, while another group staged a procession in the town that ended at the press club. Speakers there demanded justice and called for the cancellation of Jatiya Party's registration with the Election Commission. In Pabna, Gono Odhikar Parishad men blocked the Jamuna bridge west zone intersection in Sirajganj for nearly half an hour around 12:30pm. Hatikumrul Highway Police Station OC Ismail Hossain said they removed the demonstrators after a few minutes of the blockade. Gono Odhikar Parishad activists also blocked the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway at Chandana intersection in Gazipur's Basao for about one and a half hours from around 6:00pm. They organised a torch procession and protest rally blocking the road in Gopalganj as well.

The victim is Maria Akhtar, 12, daughter of Masud Islam of Tarail upazila of Kishoreganj. Around 4:30pm, when her body was taken to the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, doctors declared her dead on arrival, said Inspector Md Faruk, in-charge of DMCH police outpost. The victim had marks on her neck. The body has been kept in the morgue for autopsy, he said. At the hospital, her employer and a homemaker, Nasrin Sultana, said Maria has been working at her house for three months. \"In the afternoon, I left Maria at home and went to the market. When I returned home around 3:00pm and knocked on the door, I got no response. Later, I opened the door with a spare key and found Maria's body hanging from a fan, with a scarf tied around her neck,\" she said. After bringing her body down, she was first taken to Bangladesh Medical University, and later to DMCH, where the doctors examined her and declared her dead. A crowd, clearly upset, was in front of the woman's house. She was brought to the police station for her safety, said Dhanmondi Police Station Officer-in-Charge Kya Shi Nyu Marma. He said, \"We sent the body to DMC morgue for autopsy. We will know more after the post-mortem.\" Meanwhile, Maria's grandmother said that they live in the Rayebazar area. In the afternoon, through Maria's employer, they learned that Maria had \"hanged herself\" and was taken to DMCH. \"Later, upon reaching Dhaka medical, I saw Maria's body. However, we are yet to find out how or why this happened,\" she said. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

An intense monsoon rainstorm in the Indian-administered territory since Tuesday has caused widespread chaos, with raging water smashing into bridges and swamping homes. A local disaster official told AFP that Ramban and Reasi districts were hit by heavy rainfall and landslides on Friday night, killing 11 people. One child aged five was trapped in the debris and still missing, he added. On Wednesday, a landslide slammed the pilgrimage route to the Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi in Jammu, killing 41 people. India's Meteorological Department said the torrential rain had smashed records at two locations in the region. Jammu and Udhampur recorded their highest 24-hour rainfall on Wednesday, with 296 millimetres (11.6 inches) in Jammu, nine percent higher than the 1973 record, and 629.4 mm (24.8 inches) in Udhampur -- a staggering 84 percent surge over the 2019 mark. Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact. Climate experts from the Himalayan-focused International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development warn that a spate of disasters illustrates the dangers when extreme rain combines with mountain slopes weakened by melting permafrost, as well as building developments in flood-prone valleys. Powerful torrents driven by intense rain smashed into Chisoti village in Indian-administered Kashmir on August 14, killing at least 65 people and leaving another 33 missing. Floods on August 5 overwhelmed the Himalayan town of Dharali in India's Uttarakhand state and buried it in mud. The likely death toll from that disaster is more than 70 but has not been confirmed. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",

    "title": "Trump 'no longer has plans' to visit India for Quad Summit: NYT",
    "content": "Law enforcers swoop on Gono Odhikar during clash with JP in Kakrail Latif Siddique, 15 others sued under Anti-Terrorism Act, sent to jail 43 bodies a month recovered from rivers this year Latif Siddique refuses to seek bail US President Donald Trump \"no longer has plans\" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, The New York Times claimed yesterday, as it detailed how relations between the American leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"unraveled\" over the last few months. In the report titled \"The Nobel Prize and a Testy Phone Call: How the Trump-Modi Relationship Unraveled\", the NYT, citing people familiar with Trump's schedule, said that \"After telling Mr Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall.\" There was no official comment from either the US or India on the NYT's claim. India will host leaders of Australia, Japan and the US for the Quad Summit, scheduled to be held in New Delhi around November. The Trump administration hosted the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in January this year, a day after Trump took the oath of office as President for a second term in the White House. Amid trade tensions between Delhi and Washington, the NYT article gives an account of how relations between Trump and Modi \"unraveled\" after Trump's repeated claims of solving the four-day conflict in May between India and Pakistan, an assertion denied by India. \"President Trump's repeated claims about having 'solved' the India-Pakistan war infuriated Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. And that was only the beginning,\" the NYT article said, adding that Modi was \"losing patience\" with Trump. Trump and Modi had spoken over the phone on June 17, a 35-minute phone call that happened as Trump returned to Washington from the G7 Summit in Canada, which PM Modi also attended. Modi and Trump were scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis, but Trump returned to Washington early. Before departing Kananaskis and wrapping up his first visit to Canada in a decade, Modi had a phone conversation with Trump in Washington. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had said in a video message from Kananaskis that Modi clearly conveyed to Trump that at \"no point\" during the days following Operation Sindoor was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US trade deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan. The discussion to cease military action took place directly between India and Pakistan through the existing channels of communication between the two armed forces, and it was initiated at Pakistan's request. Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India does not and will never accept mediation, Misri had said. The NYT article said that during the June 17 phone call, Trump said again how proud he was of ending the military escalation and mentioned that Pakistan was going to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour that has been bestowed on former US President Barack Obama and one for which Trump has been \"openly campaigning\". \"The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same,\" and also nominate Trump for the Nobel, the paper said. \"The Indian leader bristled. He told Mr Trump that US involvement had nothing to do with the recent ceasefire. It had been settled directly between India and Pakistan,\" the NYT said. \"Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi's comments, but the disagreement -- and Mr Modi's refusal to engage on the Nobel -- has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr. Trump's first term,\" the NYT said. The NYT noted that the White House did not acknowledge the June 17 call, nor did Trump post about it on his social media accounts. Trump has repeated his claim of stopping the conflict between India and Pakistan over 40 times since May 10. \"And it is also the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan,\" it added. The report added that, as Trump imposed additional tariffs of 25 per cent on India for its purchases of Russian oil, \"the colossal penalties on India in particular appear to be punishment for not falling in line rather than any kind of cohesive effort to reduce the trade deficit or cut off funding for\" Putin's war. The NYT article quoted chair on India at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Richard Rossow, as saying that it was \"about more than just Russia.\" \"If this was a real change in policy in trying to squeeze Russia, Trump could have put his weight behind legislation that would have imposed secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian hydrocarbons. The fact that they have uniquely targeted India says this is about more than just Russia,\" Rossow was quoted as saying. The NYT article further said that Trump, \"frustrat",

However, that development is a capitalist type of development which creates inequality, isolation, and destroys nature,\" he said. He was speaking as the chief guest of the Bazlur Rahman Memorial Award 2024 ceremony, organised by the Liberation War Museum at its auditorium in the capital. Prof Choudhury, one of the country's most revered intellectuals, said people had fought the Liberation War in 1971 to free themselves from oppression, achieve economic freedom, and end discrimination. He stressed that the dream of liberation was a dream of social revolution \"to establish collective and social ownership in place of individual ownership\". But while the country has seen economic development, the number of extreme poor has doubled in the last three years, he noted. He pointed out that incidents of rape have also risen alarmingly, with the number in the first six months of this year almost equalling the total of last year. These have happened when \"the country has seen the fall of a fascist government and everyone is talking about a revolution\", he said. He also described the destruction and mass killings in today's world as \"unparalleled.\" \"Never before has there been such an event, never before has there been so much progress, and never before has there been so much human suffering, so much human despair,\" he said. Stressing the importance of journalism about the Liberation War, he said while the number of people killed is often cited, there are only a few writings on the sufferings and horrific experiences endured. At the ceremony, this year's Bazlur Rahman Memorial Award was handed to Shahadat Parvez, photography editor of Desh Rupantor, in the print category, and Shafiqul Islam, head of news at Ekattor Television, in electronic media. Each received a crest and Tk 1,00,000 in prize money. The programme was also addressed by Liberation War Museum Member Secretary and Trustee Mofidul Hoque and Trustee Sarwar Ali. জাপা চেয়ারম্যান জি এম কাদেরের বাসভবন ঘিরে আইনশৃঙ্খলা বাহিনীর কড়া নিরাপত্তার মধ্যে আজ ঢাকার উত্তরার ৭ নম্বর সেক্টরে তার বাড়ির সামনে ‘সাধারণ মানুষ ও উত্তরার শিক্ষার্থীরা’ ব্যানারে একদল লোক বিক্ষোভ...",
