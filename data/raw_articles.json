    "title": "Bangladesh Agricultural University: Students vacating halls, a section to continue movement",
    "content": "Following the declaration of an indefinite closure of Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, a section of students has begun vacating their residential halls. The university administration instructed all students to leave the halls by 9:00am today, Monday. At around 7:30am, the situation on campus appeared tense, with police and Rapid Action Battalion personnel stationed at the main entrance. In front of July 36 Hall and Begum Rokeya Hall, female students were seen leaving with their bags and books. Three female students stated that the attack by outsiders on students at night, Sunday, was deplorable. They added that staying in the halls could lead to further problems and due to family pressure, they were compelled to leave. In front of Ashraful Haque Hall, at least five male students remarked that a similar midnight eviction notice had been issued prior to the fall of the Awami League government in July last year. They claimed that history was repeating itself and that new forms of autocracy were emerging on campus, which prompted the sudden night-time order to vacate. Earlier, at 10:30pm on Sunday night, students rejected the directive to vacate the halls and presented four demands. They are: the single degree system, namely the continuation of the combined degree, must be upheld; the entire proctorial body must resign for allowing outsiders to attack students; the Vice-Chancellor must publicly apologise for incidents involving outsiders detonating explosives, vandalising the library and facilities and attacking students with local weapons. There must be a firm assurance that such incidents will not occur again and teachers involved in these attacks must face exemplary punishment. Students announced the commencement of a programme at 8:00am on  Monday to press home their demands. They stated that at 8:00am, students from every hall would gather at the university’s KR Market, where the programme would be observed. A blackout programme across the university was also declared, under which no student from any faculty would attend classes, examinations, or participate in any academic activities until their demands were met. At 9:00am, students from Mowlana Bhashani Hall staged a procession on campus, carrying sticks and chanting slogans demanding justice for the previous night’s attacks and protesting against the decision to vacate the halls. Simultaneously, students from other halls also began marching towards KR Market. Following the attack on students by outsiders the previous night, members of the army, BGB, RAB and police patrolled the campus throughout the night. In a statement issued at 11:05pm on Sunday, the BGB announced that, upon request from the deputy commissioner, they had been deployed at 10:10pm to the Bangladesh Agricultural University area to support the civil administration in bid to control the situation, alongside the army, police and other law enforcement agencies. Students alleged that individuals carried out the assault on those from the Faculty of Animal Husbandry and the Faculty of Veterinary Science, who had been demonstrating for the continuation of the combined degree. The attack reportedly took place at around 7:45pm on Sunday evening. In protest, the students had confined the Vice-Chancellor and over two hundred teachers inside the Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Auditorium from 1:00pm onwards that day. Commenting on the incident late Sunday night, the University Proctor, Professor Abdul Alim, stated, “I was one of the last to leave. Upon exiting, I saw several people holding sticks. I could not ascertain whether they were outsiders or university staff, as it was already late at night.”",

    "title": "Chittagong University clashes: Classes, exams remain suspended",
    "content": "Classes and examinations at Chittagong University (CU) remain suspended today, Monday, following violent clashes with local villagers. Despite two rounds of confrontations, no case had been filed as of this morning. The campus, usually abuzz with activity, lay under an eerie silence, though administrative functions, including recruitment tests, continued at the university’s offices. The university has about 27,550 students across 48 departments and six institutes. After the clashes, all examinations scheduled for Sunday were postponed, while regular classes were largely disrupted. However, the recruitment test took place as planned. During a visit this morning to the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Shaheed Minar, Gol Chattar, and Gate no. 2 areas, the campus appeared nearly deserted, with only a handful of students scattered across places that are normally filled with crowds and chatter. According to university sources, buses for teachers, officers, and staff, as well as student shuttle trains, are running on schedule. Confirming the suspension of academic activities, Acting Controller of Examinations Professor Momtaz Uddin Ahmed told Prothom Alo, “Considering yesterday’s situation, classes and exams have been suspended today. Teachers’ buses are operating as usual. Whether classes will resume tomorrow, Tuesday will be announced shortly.” The unrest began around 12:30 am Saturday night and continued intermittently until 3:00 pm Sunday, as students clashed with residents of nearby Jobra village. At least 220 people were injured, about 200 of them students. The conflict reportedly erupted after a dormitory security guard allegedly assaulted a female student. University authorities, including Pro Vice Chancellors Professor Mohammad Shamim Uddin Khan and Professor Md Kamal Uddin, as well as Proctor Tanvir Mohammad Haidar Arif, tried to mediate, but the situation quickly escalated. Bricks and stones were hurled as both sides engaged in repeated chases and counterattacks. Students were seen wielding rods, pipes, wooden sticks, and stones, while villagers carried machetes, rods, and pipes. Jobra village soon turned into a battlefield, with clashes spilling into narrow alleys. Many students were trapped and beaten there, some left bleeding from sharp weapon injuries, and rushed to the university medical centre one after another. By early afternoon Sunday, the Hathazari upazila administration imposed Section 144 (prohibitory orders) across the university area. Three students remain critically injured and are receiving treatment at two private hospitals in Chattogram city. One of them has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Despite the violence, police confirmed that no case had been filed as of this morning. Hathazari Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Abu Kawsar Mohammad Hossain told Prothom Alo at 10:00 am, “No case has been filed over the Chittagong University clashes, and no one has been detained yet.” University Acting Registrar Professor Mohammad Saiful Islam said, “The administration is preparing to file a case over the incident. We hope classes and exams will return to normal tomorrow. The university is taking full responsibility for the injured students. Whether they are at hospitals or clinics, all medical expenses are being borne by the university.” According to students, the unrest started when a female student from the Department of Philosophy, who rents a room in a building near gate no. 2 of the university, was assaulted by the building’s security guard around 12:15 am Saturday night. When she tried to enter the building, the guard allegedly stopped and assaulted her. Students stationed at gate no. 2 attempted to catch him, but he fled. As students chased after him, local residents began pelting bricks and stones, triggering a clash and repeated chases between the two sides. The student later told Prothom Alo, “When I returned home, I asked the guard to open the gate, but he refused. When I called out loudly, he started verbally abusing me. When I protested, he suddenly slapped me. As soon as my roommates came downstairs, he pushed me to the ground and started kicking me. My roommates and neighbours rushed to help.” When news of the assault spread, students gathered near Jobra village adjacent to gate no. 2. Heated arguments soon escalated into violence. Around 3:30 am, army personnel arrived at the scene, prompting both sides to retreat, though the situation remained tense. At least 70 people were injured that night alone, including 10 who suffered machete wounds. Following the late-night clashes, local residents blocked traffic from gate no. 2 through Jobra onto the Chattogram–Hathazari highway.",

    "title": "Afghanistan earthquake kills 622 with more than 1,500 injured",
    "content": "About 622 people were killed and more than 1,500 injured in an earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan, authorities said on Monday, as helicopters ferried the wounded to safety from rubble being combed in the hunt for survivors. The disaster will further stretch the resources of the South Asian nation already grappling with humanitarian crises, from a sharp drop in aid to a huge pushback of its citizens from neighbouring countries. The quake of magnitude 6 injured more than 1,500, the Taliban-run Afghan interior ministry said in a statement that put the death toll at 622. Earlier state-run broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) put the toll at about 500. In Kabul, the capital, health authorities said rescuers were racing to reach remote hamlets dotting an area with a long history of earthquakes and floods. \"Figures from just a few clinics show over 400 injured and dozens of fatalities,\" ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman said in a statement that warned of higher casualties. Images from Reuters Television showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped soldiers and medics carry the wounded to ambulances. Three villages were razed in the province of Kunar, with substantial damage in many others, the health ministry said. Reports showed 250 dead and 500 injured, said Najibullah Hanif, the provincial information head of Kunar, adding that the tally could change. Early reports showed 30 dead in a single village, with hundreds of injured taken to hospital, authorities said. Rescuers were scrambling to find survivors in the area bordering Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, where homes of mud and stone were levelled by the midnight quake hit at a depth of 10 km (6 miles). \"So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,\" a foreign office spokesperson said. Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than 1,000 people last year, underscoring the vulnerability of one of the world's poorest countries to natural disasters.",

    "content": "Hundreds were feared dead and injured in a earthquake of magnitude 6 that struck Afghanistan's rugged northeastern province of Kunar, authorities said on Monday, as rescuers combed the rubble of homes in a hunt for survivors. Early reports showed 30 dead in a single village, the health ministry said, but added that accurate casualty figures had yet to be gathered in an area of scattered hamlets with a long history of earthquakes and flooding. \"The number of casualties and injuries is high, but since the area is difficult to access, our teams are still on site,\" health ministry spokesperson Sharafat Zaman said in a statement. Hundreds of injured were taken to hospital, said Najibullah Hanif, the provincial information head, with figures likely to rise as reports arrived from remote areas with few roads. Rescuers were working in several districts of the mountainous province where the midnight quake hit at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), to level homes of mud and stone on the border with Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, officials said.

    "title": "BNP’s 47th founding anniversary today",
    "content": "Today, 1 September, marks the 47th founding anniversary of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The BNP has taken up various programmes including discussions and processions to mark the occasion. The late President Ziaur Rahman founded the BNP on this day in 1978. He was the party’s founding chairman. On 30 May, 1981, Ziaur Rahman was killed in Chattogram during a failed military coup. Following a series of events, on 21 February, 1983, his wife, Khaleda Zia, took over the party’s leadership. She remains the chairperson of the party. During the ousted Awami League government’s tenure, Khaleda Zia was arrested on 8 February, 2018, and sentenced in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. She spent more than two years in prison. At 79 years old, Khaleda Zia is no longer active in politics due to legal battles, imprisonment, and later illness. Since February 2018, her son Tarique Rahman has been serving as the party’s acting chairman. He has been living in the UK since the military-backed caretaker government took power in 2007 and has been directing the party from there. BNP has been out of power for more than 17 years. On the occasion of the party’s 47th founding anniversary, acting chairman Tarique Rahman issued a message to the media yesterday, Sunday, extending greetings to leaders, workers, and well-wishers. In his message, he said that true democracy has not yet been established in the country. Only by ensuring the rule of law, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and the independence of the judiciary can people’s democratic rights be realised. For this, a people-elected and accountable government is essential. In a separate message yesterday, BNP’s Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said that only by holding free and fair elections and strengthening the rule of law can citizens’ freedoms be ensured. He added that the authoritarian structure built over the years must be uprooted to establish a tolerant, peaceful, and socially just society—something that must be the core objective of nationalist forces. Party flag was hoisted at the BNP’s central office and all its district offices across the country in the morning. The party leaders and activists will offer fateha and pay tribute at the grave of party founder Ziaur Rahman in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Discussions and rallies will also be held across districts and metropolitan areas today. Tomorrow, Tuesday, a rally will be brought out from in front of the BNP’s central office. On Wednesday, 3 September, discussions and rallies will take place at the upazila and municipal levels. In addition, commemorative supplements will be published in newspapers, posters will be distributed, and BNP will organise roundtable discussions on contemporary and relevant issues.",

    "title": "Primary school teacher recruitment circular to be published soon",
    "content": "A recruitment circular for the post of assistant teachers in government primary schools is expected to be published shortly. To this end, the primary and mass education ministry has formed an eight-member “Central Primary School Teacher Recruitment Committee.” According to a notification issued by the ministry on Sunday, 31 August, the committee has been constituted under the Government Primary School Teacher Recruitment Rules, 2025. The Director General of the Directorate of Primary Education has been appointed as chairman of the committee, while the director (Policy and Operations) of the Directorate of Primary Education will serve as member-secretary. Other members of the committee include, the additional secretary (Schools) of the ministry, the director general (Revenue) of the Directorate of Primary Education, the director general of the Bureau of Non-Formal Education, the joint secretary (Schools) of the ministry, a representative from the public administration ministry (not below the rank of deputy secretary) and a representative from the Bangladesh Public Service Commission. Earlier, on 28 August, the ministry issued a gazette notification on the Government Primary School Teacher Recruitment Rules, 2025. According to the new rules, 93 per cent of directly recruitable posts in government primary schools will be filled on merit, while the remaining 7 per cent will be reserved under quotas. Of these, 5 per cent will be reserved for children of freedom fighters, martyred freedom fighters and Birangona; 1 per cent for candidates from ethnic minority groups; and 1 per cent for candidates with disabilities and those of the third gender. However, if no eligible candidates are found under the quota system, the vacant posts will be filled purely on merit. The notification further states that recruitment will be carried out at the upazila level and, in certain cases, at the thana level. Teachers may be appointed through both direct recruitment and promotion. Additionally, 20 per cent of posts will be reserved for graduates with degrees in science, while the remaining 80 per cent will be reserved for graduates in other disciplines. For promotion, candidates must have a minimum of 12 years’ service experience, including basic training and confirmation of service, in the post of Assistant Teacher, Assistant Teacher (Music), or Assistant Teacher (Physical Education). For direct recruitment, candidates must hold a bachelor’s or bachelor’s (honours) degree, or an equivalent qualification, from a recognised university, with at least a second division or equivalent CGPA. At no stage of academic life shall a third division, equivalent GPA, third class, or equivalent CGPA be acceptable. In addition, as specified in Schedule-2 of the Teacher Recruitment Rules, candidates must pass both written and oral examinations. Previously, under the 2019 Rules, recruitment of assistant teachers in primary schools reserved 60 per cent of posts for women, 20 per cent for men and 20 per cent under the descendant quota. With the enforcement of the new rules, the 2019 Rules shall be deemed repealed. According to the information provided in Schedule-2 of the Recruitment Rules, appointments to the post of Assistant Teacher will be made through written and oral examinations. The written examination will cover four subjects - Bangla, English, Mathematics and Daily Science and General Knowledge (Bangladesh and International Affairs). The written examination will carry a total of 90 marks. Bangla and English will carry 25 marks each, totalling 50 marks, while Mathematics and Daily Science, and General Knowledge (Bangladesh and International Affairs) will carry 20 marks each, totalling 40 marks. Selected candidates who pass the written examination will then appear for an oral examination carrying 10 marks. The pass mark for the written examination is set at 45 out of 90 (50 per cent) and for the oral examination it is 5 out of 10 (50 per cent). The written test will be of 90 minutes’ duration, while the oral test will have no fixed time limit. The new rules have also introduced the posts of Assistant Teacher (Music) and Assistant Teacher (Physical Education). Furthermore, the maximum age limit for direct recruitment has been raised to 32 years, whereas previously it was 30 years. Meanwhile, sources at the Directorate of Primary Education have indicated that approximately 17,000 candidates may be appointed to primary teaching posts.",

    "title": "Deadly quakes rattle eastern Afghanistan",
    "content": "At least 10 people were killed by a strong magnitude 6.0 earthquake and multiple aftershocks in eastern Afghanistan, provincial Nangarhar government officials said on Monday. \"In Dara-i-Nur district, the death toll has reached nine, and the number of injured has reached 20,\" a Nangarhar government statement said. The head of the Nangarhar provincial hospital, Fahimullah Dilawar, later said another person had died, bringing the confirmed toll to ten. Two children were killed when the roof of their home caved in during the shaking, according to initial reports from provincial authorities. AFP photos showed several injured children seen receiving treatment at a nearby hospital. The earthquake struck just before midnight, shaking buildings from Kabul to neighbouring Pakistan's capital Islamabad, around 370 kilometres (230 miles) away, for several seconds, AFP journalists said. The epicentre of the quake, which struck at a relatively shallow depth of eight kilometres, was 27 kilometres from the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, according to the US Geological Survey. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deep tremors. A series of aftershocks followed throughout the night, including a powerful and shallow 5.2-magnitude quake just after 4 am (23:30 GMT Sunday). Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. Nangarhar province was also hit by flooding overnight Friday to Saturday, which killed five people and destroyed crops and property, provincial authorities said. Last year a series of strong quakes jolted Afghanistan's Herat province, killing more than 1,500 people and damaging or destroying more than 63,000 homes, according to an assessment by the United Nations, the European Union and the Asian Development Bank. Ravaged by four decades of war, Afghanistan is already contending with a humanitarian disaster. With the return of the Taliban, foreign aid to Afghanistan has shrunk dramatically, undermining the already impoverished nation's ability to respond to disasters. In 2015, more than 380 people were killed in Pakistan and Afghanistan when a powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake ripped across the two countries, with the bulk of the deaths in Pakistan. In that disaster, 12 young Afghan girls were crushed to death in a stampede as they tried to flee their shaking school building.2",

    "title": "DUCSU elections were held only seven times in 54 years",
    "content": "Dhaka University was founded in 1921. Four years later, the first elections to central student union were held in 2024-25 sessions. Since then, the student union polls took place only 37 times in a century, though it was supposed to be held every year. After Bangladesh got independence, the DU student union elections were held only seven times. In line with the constitution, Dhaka University Central Student Union (DUCSU) and hall unions mainly worked in protecting the rights of the students, holding debate, cultural, and sports programmes and publishing different types of publications till 1950s. The trend continued in 1960s. However, in the early 1960s, the education movement, the movement against Ayub Khan’s military rule, and the 1969 mass uprising brought the political role of DUCSU and various student organisations into prominence. After the Liberation War of 1971, political party’s influence in student politics grew stronger. Following the restoration of democracy in 1991, DUCSU elections were discontinued. Nearly three decades later, in 2019, elections for DUCSU and hall unions were held once. But after that controversial election, DUCSU and the hall unions failed to play the role expected of them. After the fall of the Awami League government in the July uprising, DUCSU elections are now being held again. Ahead of the 9 September election, several big questions have surfaced. Will Dhaka University once again fall under the grip of party-dominated student politics? Will the organisations be controlled by the ruling party’s student wing? Will students again be forced into gono room (crammed rooms controlled by ruling party student wing in residential halls), compelled to join processions, and subjected to torture and repression as before? Students and teachers say that the culture of hall domination and torture is a major issue in this DUCSU and hall union elections. Those who have opposed it are likely to do well in the polls. For this reason, even student organisations tied to political parties have nominated relatively well-known leaders who have been vocal about student rights. Beyond the student wings directly linked to political parties, strong panels and candidates are also visible this time. Students want to ensure that the culture of hall domination, Gono rooms, guest rooms (torture under the guise of teaching etiquette), and forced participation in processions do not return. Instead, they want DUCSU and the hall unions to consistently speak up for student rights. They want peace, discipline, and a proper learning environment on campus, along with programmes such as speeches, debates, recitations, essay competitions, indoor sports, and cultural events. Ahmed Sojib, a student of the Department of Anthropology at Dhaka University, told Prothom Alo, “We want representatives who will ensure that every student gets a hall seat from the first year, that gono rooms and guest rooms never return, that canteens and cafeterias provide good food at affordable prices, and that the learning environment remains intact.”He added that with regular student union elections, candidates will have to safeguard their organisation’s or their own personal image, which will lead to changes in their behavior toward students. DUCSU and hall union leaders are elected student representatives of Dhaka University. When the university was founded in 1921, there was no DUCSU. In 2019, the late writer and researcher Syed Abul Maksud wrote an article in Prothom Alo titled “How the student union was formed at Dhaka University.” In it, he explained that after the university opened on 1 July, 1921, the Muslim Hall Union was established on 23 September. Soon after, Dhaka Hall Union and Jagannath Hall Union were formed, and in the 1924–25 academic year, the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union was established. In 1953–54, its constitution was revised and renamed as Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU). In the beginning, the election process was different. Elections were first held for the hall unions, and DUCSU representatives were chosen from there. The DUCSU VP (Vice President) and GS (General Secretary) were elected by the votes of these representatives. Each year, the VP and GS posts would rotate among different halls. In 1970, direct voting began, meaning that the VP, GS, and central student union leaders were elected directly by the students. In his book History of the Student Movement in Bangladesh (1830–1971), Mohammad Hannan describes DUCSU elections of that era. At the time, DU elections had unique practices. In hall union campaigns, organisation leaders would give speeches from different platforms in events known as “platform campaigns.” Typically, central union candidates spoke in Bangla, while most hall candidates spoke in English, displaying their knowledge of national and international politics, literature, and culture. During the 1960s, the two strongest student groups were the Chhatra Union and the C",

    "content": "Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed today said nearly 80 per cent of the judicial reform programme announced earlier has already been implemented. “Almost 80 per cent of the judicial reform programme has already been executed. I hope the remaining steps will also be implemented with the cooperation of the government,” the Chief Justice said. He was speaking this evening as the chief guest at a discussion titled “July Uprising: Judicial Reforms” organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) at its auditorium. He stressed the need for completing the process of ensuring full institutional autonomy of the judiciary, enhancing transparency in its functions, maintaining discipline in the conduct of judicial officers, and extending the reform process to every court across the country. Refaat Ahmed said the judiciary is working relentlessly to restore its full independence and discipline, adding, “The judiciary must serve the people with fairness, courage and integrity.” Expressing optimism over the establishment of an independent secretariat for the Supreme Court, he said, “One of the most important proposals before the government is to set up a separate secretariat for the Supreme Court. If implemented, this will further strengthen the constitutional separation of powers and independence of the judiciary.” The Chief Justice said the credibility of the judiciary largely depends on the fairness of judicial appointments. He termed the activation of the Supreme Judicial Appointment Council a historic step, as it has introduced a collegium-based system that ensures transparency and participation in judicial recruitment. SCBA President Barrister AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon presided over the discussion, while Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman, Bangladesh Bar Council Vice Chairman and senior lawyer Zainul Abedin, Gono Forum Executive President and senior lawyer Subrata Chowdhury, and BNP Law Affairs Secretary Barrister Kaiser Kamal also spoke.",

    "content": "Adam Zampa's marathon 21,000 mile (34,000 kilometre) round trip from Australia just to bowl 20 balls paid dividends as the Oval Invincibles won their third successive final in English cricket's Hundred with a 26-run victory over the Trent Rockets at Lord's on Sunday. Zampa'S near 30-hour journey came about after the 33-year-old, who's been on international duty with Australia, was summoned as a replacement for fellow leg-spinner Rashid Khan, called up to play for Afghanistan. Zampa, who had starred in the Invincibles previous two title-winning campaigns, took a miserly 1-21 from his maximum 20 balls on Sunday, with the veteran having Rockets dangerman David Willey stumped for 14. He was not the only Australian leg-spinner in the wickets for the Invincibles. Penrith-born but England-qualified Nathan Sowter took 3-25 -- including the prize scalp of England great Joe Root for 10 -- as the Rockets set 169 to win, were held to 142-8. It was something of an 'Australia Day' at Lord's, with all-rounder Marcus Stoinis returning figures of 2-40 for the Rockets before top-scoring for the Nottingham-based side with a quickfire 64, including four fours and five sixes, that ended when he was lbw to England quick Saqib Mahmood. England's Will Jacks laid the foundations for the Invincibles' win with a 41-ball 72 at the top of the order, although he was reprieved on 28 by a Stoinis no-ball after the Rockets lost New Zealand fast bowler Lockie Ferguson to injury in the warm-up. Australia internationals also took centre stage in the preceding women's final, with Annabel Sutherland, Nicola Carey and Phoebe Litchfield, the player of the tournament, starring as the Northern Superchargers defeated the Southern Brave by seven wickets. The 23-year-old Sutherland took 2-23, with the Brave, previously unbeaten in this season's edition, held to 115-6 in the 100 balls per side showpiece match. Then, in front of a bumper crowd of 22,542 at Lord's, Sutherland's 28 not out helped put the result beyond doubt after the Superchargers had faltered at 59-3. Sutherland shared an unbroken stand of 60 with Carey (35 not out) and ended the match in style courtesy of a six down the ground as the Superchargers, taking the title for the first time, won with 12 balls to spare. Litchfield had led the run-chase with 26, including four fours and a six, to become the top-scorer of the tournament, with her 292 runs taking her past former Australia captain Meg Lanning, now of the Invincibles.",

    "title": "US would control Gaza, displace all its people under new plan: Report",
    "content": "The entire population of Gaza would be relocated and the United States would take control of the Palestinian territory under a plan being considered by the Trump administration, the Washington Post reported Sunday. The enclave reduced to rubble in Israel's war prompted by the Hamas attack of 2023 would be transformed into a trusteeship administered by the United States for at least 10 years, the newspaper said. Another goal of the plan modeled on President Donald Trump's stated vision of making it the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" is to transform Gaza -- land which the Palestinians want to be part of a future state -- into a tourism resort and high tech hub, said the Post, which viewed a 38-page prospectus outlining the initiative. It calls for at least temporary relocation of all of Gaza's population of two million, either through \"voluntary\" departures to another country or into restricted, secured zones inside the enclave during reconstruction, the newspaper said. Gaza residents who own land would be given a digital token by the trust in exchange for the right to develop their property. Recipients can use this token to start a new life somewhere else or eventually redeem it for an apartment in one of six to eight new \"AI-powered, smart cities\" to be built in Gaza, according to the plan.The Post quoted people familiar with the trust's planning and with administration deliberations over postwar Gaza. The State Department did not immediately reply to an AFP request for comment. Trump stunned the world earlier this year when he suggested the United States should take control of the Gaza Strip, clear out all its people and build seaside real estate. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the proposal, which was heavily criticized by many European and Arab states. Trump chaired a meeting last week on postwar plans for Gaza but the White House did not release a read-out afterward or announce any decisions. The body that would administer Gaza under the plan now being considered would be called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, said the Post. The Post said the proposal was developed by some of the same Israelis who created the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distributing food inside the enclave amid much criticism from aid groups and the United Nations. On 22 July, the UN rights office said Israeli forces had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations, nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites.",

    "title": "Impact of PK Halder’s irregularities: Financial institutions in loss for over half a decade",
    "content": "Bangladesh Bank had issued closure notices to 20 financial institutions burdened with high defaulted loans and unable to repay depositors. Now the central bank has moved to liquidate nine. Bangladesh’s non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) continue to reel from the legacy of Prashanta Kumar (PK) Halder’s financial manoeuvring, which has left the sector mired in sustained crisis. For six consecutive years, the industry has been posting losses, with aggregate deficits reaching Tk 35.55 billion (3,555 crore) at the close of 2024—almost double the Tk 18.03 billion (1,803 crore) loss recorded in 2023. The decline of the NBFI sector can be traced back to 2014, when PK Halder, then managing director (MD) of one institution, exercised covert control over four others under various guises. Through these, he channelled out a huge amount of money under the pretext of loans, a pattern of malpractice that mirrored the scandals of the S Alam, with whom he was closely aligned. The collapse of several of these institutions has now dragged down the sector as a whole. According to Bangladesh Bank, there are currently 35 NBFIs in operation—22 domestically owned and 13 joint ventures with foreign partners. Of those, 20 were served notices to explain why they should not be shut down owing to unmanageable defaulted loans and chronic liquidity shortfalls. Eleven of them have submitted turnaround plans, while nine face closure, with both the central bank and the government endorsing the move. The central bank has also taken steps to set up a depositors’ protection fund to compensate savers of the failed firms. While the sector at large suffers, some institutions continue to thrive. Those include IDLC Finance, IPDC Finance, LankaBangla Finance, DBH Finance, EDCL, United Finance and National Housing. Their profitability offsets part of the wider decline, though the sector’s consolidated losses now exceed Tk 35 billion. The central bank has issued closure notices to 20 institutions, including CVC Finance, Bay Leasing, Islamic Finance, Meridian Finance, GSP Finance, Hajj Finance, National Finance, IIDFC, Premier Leasing, Prime Finance, Uttara Finance, Aviva Finance, Phoenix Finance, Peoples Leasing, First Finance, Union Capital, International Leasing, BIFC, Fareast Finance and FAS Finance. Of these, nine—including FAS Finance, BIFC, Peoples Leasing, International Leasing, Aviva Finance, Premier Leasing, Fareast Finance, GSP Finance and Prime Finance—are separated for liquidation. The volume of defaulted loans across NBFIs has risen steeply, from 7.9 per cent of total lending in 2018 to 15 per cent in 2020, and a staggering 33.83 per cent by the end of 2024. In other words, one in three loans is now defaulted. The sector last posted an overall profit in 2018, totalling Tk 8.3 billion (830 crore). Since then, losses have mounted relentlessly—Tk 22.2 billion (2,220 crore) in 2019, rising to Tk 35.55 billion in 2024. Annual financial statements of each organisation for 2024 reveal International Leasing alone lost Tk 8.63 billion (863 crore), BD Finance Tk 7.83 billion (783 crore), Bay Leasing Tk 4.38 billion (438 crore), IIDFC Tk 1.58 billion (158 crore) and Hajj Finance Tk 1.32 billion (132 crore). Smaller institutions such as CVC, Midas, Meridian and National Finance each reported losses ranging between Tk 300-700 million (30–70 crore). Despite the broader collapse, certain firms have remained profitable, earning recognition both domestically and internationally for their governance and resilience. IDLC Finance posted Tk 2 billion (200 crore) in profits last year, retaining its position as the leader in SME (small and medium enterprise) and sustainable financing for five consecutive years. It has expanded outreach by partnering with bKash for deposit mobilisation, bringing in 1.5 million account holders in addition to its direct customer base. IPDC Finance and United Finance also reported profits of Tk 360 million (36 crore) and Tk 21 210 million (21 crore) respectively, while DBH Finance made Tk 1.01 billion (101 crore), underpinned by robust housing finance operations. Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), with its investments in public–private partnerships, renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, posted Tk 1.71 billion (171 crore) in profits. Documents of the financial organisations reveal that, before and after the 2014 general elections, ownership of at least four NBFIs underwent abrupt and opaque changes, paving the way for PK Halder’s takeover. Through shell companies and large stock acquisitions, he gained control of International Leasing, Peoples Leasing, FAS Finance and BIFC. Once in control, he siphoned funds under fictitious loan agreements, even diverting capital abroad to set up companies. The four organisations are in dire straits now as none could return money to the depositors. Halder also held MD positions at Reliance Finance (now Aviva) and NRB Global Bank (now Global Islami Bank), from which h",

    "title": "One BCS can be completed in a year if independence given",
    "content": "A new reality has emerged in state governance following the mass uprising of 5 August 2024. Transparency, accountability, and speedy recruitment in government jobs are now the top expectations of the youth. The Public Service Commission (PSC) is the central institution in this regard. In an interview with Prothom Alo, PSC Chairman Professor Mobasser Monem spoke about the current challenges facing the commission and the prospects for reform. Golam Rabbani has taken the interview. Students have been growing increasingly frustrated due to delays in the publication of BCS recruitment circulars, examinations, and results over the years. What is the reason behind this delay? Mobasser Monem: Previously, the biggest issue in our recruitment process was the lengthy evaluation time for written exam scripts. To reduce this time, after much trial and error, we have introduced the ‘Circular System.’ From now on, examiners will come to the PSC to evaluate the answer scripts. Each script will be assessed by multiple examiners, and each examiner will evaluate only one specific question. For example, the first examiner will assess only the answer to question one, the second examiner will look at question two, and so on. This method ensures relative judgment and promotes fairness. It will save time and improve quality. Without this system, completing an exam cycle within a year is not feasible. Our goal is to complete the entire BCS process—from circular publication to recruitment—within one year. How many BCS exams are currently in progress? Mobasser Monem: At the moment, six BCS exams are ongoing. Since we took office, we have published the results of the 44th BCS. The viva voce (oral exams) for the 45th General BCS and the 48th Special BCS are underway. The written exam for the 46th BCS has been completed. The preliminary exam for the 47th BCS is scheduled to start on September 19. Additionally, the application process for the 49th Special BCS has been completed, and we are currently preparing the exam questions. You say completing one BCS in a year is possible. But with six BCS exams running simultaneously, how realistic is that goal? Mobasser Monem: We believe that if the Public Service Commission is granted full autonomy as a constitutional body, completing one BCS in a year is achievable. We have already created a roadmap. Every year, the BCS circular will be published in November, and results will be announced by October 30 of the following year. The current backlog of BCS exams is not a problem—but for this plan to work, we must be given full independence. What percentage of qualified candidates are typically found in a single BCS exam? Mobasser Monem: The number isn’t fixed; it varies. Generally, we recommend about 0.45 per cent to 0.65 per cent of candidates in a BCS exam. For example, the recommendation rate was 0.54 per cent in the 37th BCS, 0.64 per cent in the 38th, 0.48 per cent in the 40th, 0.62 per cent in the 41st, 0.49 per cent in the 43rd, and 0.48 per cent in the 44th BCS. Many engineers and physicians are now opting for administration, police, or foreign service cadres instead of the technical cadres designated for their professions. Among the last five BCS exams, out of 1,980 candidates appointed to these three cadres, 387 were engineers and physicians. What is your view on this? Mobasser Monem: Our commission hasn’t officially started working on this issue yet. But personally, I believe that every citizen has a constitutional right to freely choose their profession. No one should be deprived of that right. However, I do think this matter deserves national-level discussion. Job seekers are protesting, demanding an increase in non-cadre positions so more candidates can be recommended. Will the commission recommend more candidates from the non-cadre list? Mobasser Monem: The commission believes that the more candidates we can recruit from the non-cadre list into government service, the better. It saves both time and money, ensures talented individuals enter public service, and reduces corruption in recruitment. But for this to happen, inter-ministerial coordination is crucial. If we receive proper requisitions from the government, the PSC can indeed recommend a greater number of non-cadre candidates. In the wake of recent student movements, there have been calls for reforms in the PSC’s recruitment process. How do you view these demands? Mobasser Monem: Even before these demands arose, the new commission had already identified the areas in need of reform and began taking action. I believe the demands are reasonable. However, it is disappointing that the Public Administration Reform Commission made recommendations without consulting us. Their report had procedural flaws. Interestingly, many of the reforms they proposed were already being implemented by us. For instance: We had already set a calendar to complete each BCS cycle within a year.We reduced the application fee from 700 to 200 taka (only 50 taka",

    "title": "Haven’t seen such a dreadful state of law and order: Prof. Samina Luthfa",
    "content": "A section of politically vested quarters have deliberately destabilised Bangladesh in pursuit of their own narrow interests, observed Professor Samina Luthfa of the Department of Sociology at Dhaka University. “The government has been utterly incapable of controlling this destabilisation. We have never witnessed such a dreadful state of law and order before. Each day we step outside risking our lives,” she said. She made these remarks at an anti-repression teachers’ rally held at the foot of the Aparajeyo Bangla sculpture on Dhaka University campus, organised by the University Teachers’ Network on Sunday afternoon. The rally was convened to protest the ongoing persecution, assaults and dismissals of teachers across the country, the arbitrary mass lawsuits, organised attacks on citizens’ rights movements, and the military–police torture of Nurul Haque, president of Gono Odhikar Parishad and former DUCSU vice-president. The organisers also demanded security, dignity and justice for citizens. Referring to the violence in July 2024, Professor Samina Luthfa said, “The demand had been for the killings of July to be investigated and brought to justice. But neither an inquiry nor any trial has been seen. As a result, people appeared to have lost faith in the justice system over the past year. To this is now added a sort of competition among certain political quarters, who are exploiting the gaps in law enforcement for their own special interests, leaving Bangladesh in disarray.” Calling last year’s uprising an “eruption of public anger,” she stated, “One year has passed. Now is the time for peace, for reconstruction. This situation can no longer be allowed to persist.” Citing the incident of harassment of Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman (Karzon) of Dhaka University at the Dhaka Reporters’ Unity (DRU) on 28 August, Professor Luthfa said, “A colleague goes to express his views, to attend a protest meeting, and is subjected to humiliation at the hands of various interest groups. Yet the university administration has not uttered a single word in his defence. This suggests that the present administration is scarcely different from the self-serving one of the past. Both remain preoccupied with advancing their own political agendas, even playing games to prove their loyalties. The question remains—who will safeguard the interests of teachers? Even a teachers’ association is ineffective at the university.” She further noted that in the past year, attacks had been carried out on Baul singers, shrines, women and ethnic minorities of differing beliefs, but the state and the government were seen to remain silent and inactive. Speaking on the recent assault on Nurul Haque, Samina Luthfa said, “The brutal attack on Nurul Haque sparked a storm of condemnation across the country. After this, the government and the Home Minister in particular have no moral legitimacy to remain in office.” She also expressed her apprehensions about the forthcoming national election amid such fraught circumstances. Professor Samina Luthfa remarked, if this climate of uncertainty is to be dispelled, law and order must be improved without delay. The alarming cultivation of mob culture within universities must be brought to an end immediately. Teachers and students must no longer be attacked for their political beliefs. Others who addressed the gathering included Professor Kazi Maruful Islam of the Department of Development Studies at Dhaka University, Professor Kamrul Hasan Mamun of the Department of Physics at Dhaka University, Associate Professor Tahmina Khanam of the Department of Management at DU, and Associate Professor Nasir Uddin Ahmed of the Department of English at Jagannath University. The event was conducted by Associate Professor Moshahida Sultana of the Department of Accounting at Dhaka University.",

    "title": "‘Very dangerous for the nation’ if anyone contemplates alternative to elections: Chief Adviser",
    "content": "Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has reaffirmed that the forthcoming national election will be held within the timeframe he announced in his recent address to the nation. Speaking at a press briefing at his residence, Jamuna, following meetings with leaders of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, and the National Citizen Party (NCP), the Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam conveyed this message on Sunday night. Shafiqul Alam said, “An inclusive, free, and festive election will take place in the first half of February. The Chief Adviser has once again pledged this commitment to all political parties. He emphasised that there is no alternative to elections. If anyone contemplates an alternative, it would be very dangerous for the nation.” The meetings with political parties were also attended, at different times, by several advisers to the interim government. They include Planning Adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud, Law Adviser Asif Nazrul, Housing and Public Works Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, and National Security Adviser Khalilur Rahman. However, not all advisers were present at every meeting. At 4:30 pm today, Jamaat leaders met the Chief Adviser, followed by NCP representatives at 6:30 pm and the BNP delegation at 7:30 pm. After the meeting, Jamaat’s Naib-e-Ameer, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher expressed concerns over the government’s capacity to manage a national election. “The interim administration has failed to curb extortion. Previously one group occupied bus terminals, now another has taken over. The government has not acted against these occupiers. If it cannot manage such matters, how will it conduct a national election?” Following the meeting with NCP leaders, the party’s senior joint convener, Ariful Islam, said, “Given the legal and constitutional basis of the July Charter, the forthcoming election must certainly be a Constituent Assembly election.” BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, after their meeting with the Chief Adviser, stated, “A vested quarter is attempting to delay the election. But there is no scope for postponement. The election must be held on the date already announced, and the Chief Adviser has agreed on February as the timeline.” Responding to journalists’ questions about Jamaat’s doubts over the credibility of the polls, Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam said: “We are working on this issue. The Chief Adviser has assured that the election will be held in an exceptionally free, fair, peaceful, and festive atmosphere. He has repeatedly said it will be one of the finest elections in Bangladesh’s history.” When asked whether the Jatiya Party (JaPa) issue was discussed in the talks, the press secretary replied that it was. Different parties offered different opinions, and the Chief Adviser listened carefully. At the press briefing, journalists raised Jamaat-e-Islami’s apprehensions regarding the prospect of a fair election. In response, press secretary Shafiqul Alam said, “We are already working on this matter. The Chief Adviser has assured that the election will be conducted in a very fair, impartial, peaceful, and festive atmosphere. He has repeatedly emphasised that it will be one of the best elections in the history of Bangladesh.” Shafiqul Alam also noted that the Chief Adviser urged all political parties to remain vigilant during the upcoming Durga Puja at the end of September, stressing that no one should be allowed to exploit the occasion to create instability or engage in conspiracy. He appealed for cooperation from all quarters to maintain peace and harmony during the festival.",

    "title": "Upcoming election must be a constituent assembly election",
    "content": "Leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have called on the Chief Adviser of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, to hold a constituent assembly election in order to provide a legal foundation for the July Charter. This appeal was made during a meeting between NCP leaders and the Chief Adviser at his official residence, Jamuna. After the meeting, Ariful Islam Adib, Senior Joint Convener of the NCP, spoke to journalists outside Jamuna and shared this information. Hasnat Abdullah, Chief Organizer (Southern Region); Tasnim Jara, Senior Joint Member Secretary; and Abdul Hannan Masud, Senior Joint Chief Coordinator of the NCP were also present. On the government side, the Chief Adviser was joined by law  adviser Asif Nazrul, industries adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, and national security adviser Khalilur Rahman. Ariful Islam told journalists: \"To provide the July Charter with a legal and constitutional foundation, the upcoming election must be a constituent assembly election. Through this election, we believe a permanent solution can be found to Bangladesh’s long-standing 54- or 55-year crisis — the rise of an authoritarian mindset and a personality-centric power structure. This constituent assembly should draft a new constitution for the country.\" The NCP leader also said that those who were martyred or injured during the mass uprising in July have yet to receive proper rehabilitation, medical treatment, or security. The party has called on the government to ensure the rehabilitation and safety of the families of the martyrs and the injured.The NCP also urged the government to help repatriate individuals still detained in the United Arab Emirates for participating in rallies supporting the July uprising. In addition, the leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) urged the Chief Adviser to take clear and decisive action against members of state agencies who have been accused in the Enforced Disappearances Commission's report. They also requested Professor Muhammad Yunus to play an active role in ensuring the capacity and neutrality of the election commission. During the meeting, the NCP leaders expressed their support for banning the activities of the Jatiya Party. On this issue, Ariful Islam stated, \"There is no difference between the Jatiya Party and the Awami League. Since the organisational activities of the Awami League have already been suspended by the state, and we see that the Jatiya Party is openly supporting efforts to bring a banned organisation like the Awami League into the election... we urged the Chief Adviser to take more effective steps to suspend the organisational activities of the Jatiya Party as well.\"",

    "content": "Jamaat-e-Islami has expressed concern and apprehension over the interim government’s capacity to conduct a national election, given its failure to curb extortion, the party’s Naib-e-Ameer Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher said on Sunday. “Previously one group would take control of the bus stands; now another group has seized those. Yet the interim government has taken no visible action against these occupiers,” he told the media. A four-member delegation of Jamaat met the Chief Adviser of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, at the state guesthouse Jamuna (currently serving as the Chief Adviser’s official residence) on Sunday afternoon. Emerging from the meeting, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher briefed newspersons outside Jamuna. He led the delegation, which also included Jamaat Secretary General Mia Golam Porwar, Assistant Secretary General Rafiqul Islam Khan, and Hamidur Rahman Azad. Speaking about the upcoming election, the Jamaat Naib-e-Ameer said, “Given the time still available, if the government takes the right decisions and pursues the correct initiatives, the situation can improve. If the situation improves, then an election will be possible.” Taher noted that while the Chief Adviser had spoken of ensuring free and fair polls, Jamaat agreed in principle but differed on questions of feasibility. “The public now wonders whether the country is heading towards a blueprint election,” he remarked. Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher pointed to what he described as an “unprecedented” episode: the government’s announcement of the election date following a meeting with a particular political party in London. “This undermined the neutrality of the government and granted undue advantage to one party,” he said. The Jamaat leader thought that the announcement of the election date on the day of the “July Declaration” (5 August) appeared to have been made under pressure. “There was clearly a pressure at play,” he observed. The government should have first made its position clear regarding the July Charter, and only then announced the election roadmap and timetable, he added. Asked whether the meeting had discussed the possible banning of the Jatiya Party, Syed Abdullah Muhammad Taher said that the conspiracy surrounding the attack on Nurul Haque (President of Gono Odhikar Parishad) ran very deep. Jamaat, he stated, had urged the government to take stern action against the perpetrators. He also asserted that since the Jatiya Party had long operated as an ally of the Awami League (activities banned), the same decision taken against the Awami League should also be applied to the Jatiya Party.",

Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders from Central, South and Southeast Asia and the Middle East, in a show of Global South solidarity. The meeting comes days after Washington imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods in response to New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil, a move analysts say has pushed Modi and Xi to align against Western pressures. Modi said India and China pursued strategic autonomy, and their ties should not be seen through the lens of a third country, according to an Indian foreign ministry-readout of the meeting. Modi emphasised reducing India's trade deficit with China and expanding cooperation on regional and global issues, including terrorism and fair trade practices, the ministry added. The leaders also discussed expanding common ground on bilateral, regional, and global issues, and challenges like terrorism and fair trade in multilateral platforms, the Indian statement said. \"We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,\" Modi told Xi during the meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a video posted on his official X account. At a reception for the summit Xi told leaders that the SCO now bears \"greater responsibilities\" for safeguarding regional peace and stability, and for boosting development of various countries, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday. Modi said an atmosphere of \"peace and stability\" has been created on their disputed Himalayan border, the site of a prolonged military standoff after deadly troop clashes in 2020, which froze most areas of cooperation between the nuclear-armed strategic rivals. He added that an agreement had been reached between both nations regarding border management, without giving details. The neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. \"We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,\" Xinhua reported Xi as saying. China-India ties could be \"stable and far-reaching\" if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added. Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington. Direct flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are being resumed, Modi added, without providing a timeframe. China had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilisers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China opposes Washington's steep tariffs on India and will \"firmly stand with India,\" Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month. For decades, Washington painstakingly cultivated ties with New Delhi in the hope that it would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing. In recent months, China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Hindu and Buddhist sites in Tibet, and both countries have lifted reciprocal tourist visa restrictions. \"Both India and China are engaged in what is likely to be a lengthy and fraught process of defining a new equilibrium in the relationship,\" said Manoj Kewalramani, a Sino-Indian relations expert at the Takshashila Institution think tank in Bengaluru. However, other long-term irritants remain in the relationship. China is India's largest bilateral trade partner, but the long-running trade deficit - a persistent source of frustration for Indian officials - reached a record USD 99.2 billion this year. Meanwhile, a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet has sparked fears of mass water diversion that could reduce water flows on the major Brahmaputra River by up to 85 per cent in the dry season, according to Indian government estimates. India also hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader whom Beijing views as a dangerous separatist influence. India's arch-rival Pakistan also benefits from staunch Chinese economic, diplomatic and military support.",

We verified their images with the victim and her friend. They confirmed that the people in the images were involved,\" said CU Assistant Proctor Shahidul Islam. He also said that the university administration was fully cooperating  with police to identify all the accused in the case filed over the assault. Contacted, Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Police Station, said they could not disclose the names or identities of the identified accused for the sake of investigation. \"We identified a few people already,\" he said. Meanwhile, CU Chhatra League President Rejaul Haque Rubel claimed that he identified five people who were involved in the crime. \"One of the five is Azim Hossain, a follower of BCL sub-group 'CFC'. Azim knows about the rest of the culprits. I got five names from him,\" Rubel told this correspondent. Asked about the findings, Assistant Proctor Shahidul Islam said, \"He [Rubel] is not a part of the probe body. He cannot claim this.\" Besides, a friend of the victim who went to the proctor's office to lodge complaint that night had a peek at the CCTV footage of the incident and confirmed Azim's involvement. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Yet-to-start mega projects: Consider putting  them on hold",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly involved should be punished both",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The BNP yesterday skipped Election Commission's dialogue seeking recommendations of political parties on how to hold a free and fair general election. BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendations. It decided that the Finance",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital.

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Parties can’t be forced to join nat’l polls: CEC",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The plot was nothing special; a patch of sandy ground in front of a tired 90s building in Uttara. A garage, a storage room, a 4x4 bathroom, and some plants left to fend for themselves. Two half-dead trees — one jackfruit, one neem — stood quietly at the edge of being forgotten. But for architect S M Ehsan Uz Zaman, it wasn't just a leftover site. It was memory, erosion, resistance — and eventually, the foundation for what he calls \"The Story of a Tree.\" He convinced his client to work around the land, not over it. And that's how the Albion Art Gallery came to be — not as a sleek intervention, but as a story about not erasing what was already there. Zaman's client, Mahmood Ullah, had a clear ask; an outdoor coffee bar with seating, an exhibition space inside the old garage, and rooftop dining. Trees and ground cover were viewed as obstacles. But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed. That one decision meant giving up a few seats in the café plan. But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design. If anything, he's sceptical of how loosely the word is used. \"I don't think this project is a showcase for green architecture,\" he says. \"But maybe it starts a conversation.\" He's critical of how the industry handles ecology. \"As architects, we say we care. But we keep letting trees fall. We put a few planters on balconies and call it sustainability. We cool our buildings with air conditioning instead of shade.\" Zaman's firm, Ehsan Uz Zaman and Associates, takes on all kinds of work — residential, public, and private. But he's most drawn to commercial spaces like cafes and galleries, where design can shape behaviour and not just aesthetics. Asked if he'd host student workshops or open the space up for learning, he's unsure. \"I don't know if this project qualifies as an example,\" he says. \"But maybe it's enough to get people asking better questions.\" Albion Art Gallery isn't perfect. It isn't cutting-edge. And that's the point. It's a quiet project. One where a counter got smaller so a tree could live. One where an architect didn't try to impress anyone — he just refused to erase what was already there. Zaman didn't build for the portfolio. He built for the space. That's the story. And that's enough. Photo: Courtesy ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Around 12:30pm, hundreds of JCD activists gathered in front of the university's administration building to press home their demands. Speaking at the programme, RU Chhatra Dal General Secretary Sarder Jahurul Islam said, \"We always try to practise a different kind of politics, one that reflects the pulse of students. Many first year students requested us to ensure their inclusion in the Rucsu voter list. We have no personal interest here, this movement is for them.\" RU Chhatra Dal President Sultan Ahmed Rahi alleged that their peaceful programme was marred by scuffles yesterday. \"Even our female activists were not spared, they were harassed. The administration must take responsibility for the incident and meet our demands. Only then we will withdraw our programme. Otherwise, our protests will continue,\" he added. Several female activists alleged that they were assaulted during yesterday's programme in front of the Rucsu treasurer's office. RU Chhatra Dal Vice-President Sabiha Alam Munni said, \"We were holding a peaceful protest when a group of students confronted us aggressively. At one stage, they tore off a hijab that one of our activists had fastened with a safety pin. Later, they manhandled several of our other activists as well.\" Regarding the inclusion of first-year students, Vice-Chancellor Saleh Hasan Nakib said, \"This morning, I sat with the Election Commissioner to discuss the matter. We talked about whether it can somehow be done while keeping the scheduled date (September 25). No final decision has been made yet.\" Yesterday, Chhatra Dal activists padlocked the Rucsu treasurer's office after staging a protest demanding first-year students' inclusion in the Rucsu election. Later, former convener of SAD Salahuddin Ammar, along with Fahim Reza, Mehedi Sajeeb and several general students, tried to break the lock, while Shibir activists also appeared the scene. At least six people were reportedly injured in the ensuing scuffle. The sit-in programme was still ongoing at the time of filing this report at 1:30pm. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Most students who had been living in rented houses near the area have moved into residential halls, citing insecurity and urging the administration to restore normalcy. Shops near Gate 2 remain partially open, but movement is severely restricted. With Section 144 in force, the army and Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) continue to patrol the campus. Although offices are functioning, all classes and examinations remain suspended. The administration said the suspension will continue today, with Section 144 to remain in place until further notice. Residential halls near Gate 2 are being kept open to provide safe accommodation for students, and the university will cover the medical expenses of those injured in the attack. A probe committee will be formed today to investigate the attack, while efforts are underway to recover weapons looted from the Jobra area. To build long-term stability, the university has also set up a 21-member committee to strengthen ties with the Jobra-Fatepur area, led by Pro Vice-Chancellor (administration) Professor Kamal Uddin. The committee's first meeting is scheduled for 1:00pm today. Students described the current situation an atmosphere of fear. Naeem Ahmed, a Philosophy student, said, \"After the local attacks, those of us living off-campus are facing serious insecurity. I am now staying in a senior brother's room in a hall. We want the administration to resolve the problem quickly.\" Economics student Tahsif Hossain added, \"Our landlord has locked the house, preventing our entry. When we approached, the locals looked at us as if we could be attacked. Those of us near Gate 2 are truly insecure. I am now staying in Farhad Hall.\" Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Kamal Uddin, said, \"We are doing our utmost to bring the situation under control.

Through the students' and people's movement, we have become free from the terrible Hasina,\" Fakhrul told reporters. He made the remarks after placing a wreath at the grave of party founder and late president Ziaur Rahman, marking BNP's 47th founding anniversary. Fakhrul said BNP had endured 15 years of struggle to restore democracy, with its acting chairman Tarique Rahman leading the movement for the last eight years while living in exile. He alleged that to weaken the party, \"false cases\" were filed against about 60 lakh BNP leaders and activists, while some 20,000 were killed and 1,700 abducted or disappeared. Looking ahead to the national election scheduled for February, Fakhrul urged party leaders and activists to work together to ensure a fair vote. He said BNP, if elected, would bring \"political change and economic growth\" under Tarique Rahman's leadership. Recalling Ziaur Rahman's contributions, he said the BNP founder brought fundamental changes to politics and the economy. \"Ziaur Rahman introduced a multi-party system in place of one-party rule, ensured media freedom, people's rights, and judicial independence,\" Fakhrul said, adding that BNP also initiated the caretaker government system. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer India's Narendra Modi told Vladimir Putin on Monday that India and Russia stood side by side even in difficult times after the Kremlin chief called the Indian prime minister his \"dear friend\" and gave him a lift in his armoured limousine. China and India are the biggest buyers of crude oil from Russia, the world's second largest exporter. Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India over the purchases but there is no sign that India or China are going to stop them. On the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in China's port city of Tianjin, Modi held Putin's hand as they walked towards Chinese President Xi Jinping. All three smiled as they spoke, surrounded by translators. Later, Modi posted a picture on X of him and Putin inside the armoured Aurus limousine used by the Russian leader. Putin often travels with the Aurus on foreign trips and has occasionally offered rides to fellow leaders - or even gifted the vehicle, as he did to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2024. \"Even in the most difficult situations, India and Russia have always walked shoulder to shoulder,\" Modi said. \"Our close cooperation is important not only for the people of both countries but also for global peace, stability and prosperity.\" At the bilateral meeting, Putin addressed Modi in Russian as \"Dear Mr Prime Minister, dear friend.\" \"Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades, friendly and trusting. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future,\" Putin said. Modi said he welcomed recent efforts aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine, which he hoped would end as soon as possible. On Saturday, Modi reaffirmed his support for a peaceful settlement during a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Modi's office said. \"Had an excellent meeting with President Putin,\" Modi said on X on Monday, adding that they had discussed cooperating \"in all sectors, including trade, fertilisers, space, security and culture.\" \"Our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership remains a vital pillar of regional and global stability,\" Modi said. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The transfer took place following a flag meeting between BGB and BSF. Among the detainees were three men, four women and two children. Major Munshi Imdadur Rahman, assistant director of Maheshpur 58 BGB Battalion, said that on Saturday, the nine Bangladeshis, who had been residing illegally in India, were detained by Indian police. They were later handed over to the BSF. Yesterday, around 10:30pm, members of the BSF from Mahendra BSF Camp in Nadia, West Bengal, transferred the detainees to BGB's Srinathpur Baghdanga Border Outpost (BOP) through a border flag meeting. The BGB then handed them over to Maheshpur Police Station.

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer In a remote village of Rangpur, grief has engulfed the family of 47-year-old Pradip Lal Robidas, who was beaten to death in a mob attack at Taraganj on August 9. The \"pradip\" (oil lamp) that once lit up his home is now forever extinguished. His sixteen-year-old daughther, Palashi Robidas, an SSC candidate this year, broke down in tears saying, \"I can't take my exams anymore. My father is gone. He was beaten to death by a mob. He was our only support. Now we struggle even for a handful of rice.\" Her elder brother, Dulal Robidas, 19, passed SSC in 2022 but could not afford college. Due to poverty, he now works as a day labourer to keep the family afloat. The youngest, Apon Robidas, 13, a seventh grader, also faces an uncertain future. The family lives on borrowed land at Khamar Mokimpur village of Milonpur union in Mithapukur upazila, where six Robidas and seven Santal families reside. While most families there own their homesteads, Pradip's shelter comprised only two ramshackle tin rooms. Once a roadside cobbler, Pradip had lost his ankle to illness six years ago. With villagers' help, he received a battery-run van, which he drove to earn a modest living. Despite adversity, he dreamed of educating his children. \"Despite being physically disabled, our father worked hard to educate us. He wanted us to achieve higher studies. But the mob destroyed that dream,\" said Palashi. Apon wiped his tears and said, \"I may have to give up school. I must take up father's trade of mending shoes. Books don't fill empty stomachs.\" Dulal, now the family's sole breadwinner, said, \"I earn Tk 300–400 a day as a labourer, but it's not enough. The van my father drove is in police custody. If I had it, I could earn more. My brother and sister want to study, but I alone can't manage.\" Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Taraganj Police Station MA Faruk said that the battery-run van has been seized as evidence in the case. It has been recovered from the scene of the incident. Two people were beaten on this van. If the court decides, the van can be handed over to the family. Pradip's widow, Dulali Rani Robidas, 42, lamented, \"We live on others' land at a broken home. My husband used to work hard to bring Tk 500–600 a day. That man has been snatched from us by the mob. I am a widow now, and my children are orphans.\" \"On the noon of August 9, my husband had bought sweets from Altaf Rahma's shop and one and a half kg of dragon fruits from Sujon Islam's shop at Chowdhury Gopalpur Bazar before heading to my maternal uncle Ruplal Robidas' home in Taraganj. But that night, both men were accused of being van thieves, dragged to Burirhat Bottola area, and beaten by locals,\" Dulali said. \"We used to sit together every evening at the temple yard. Pradip always worried about his children's education. He was an honest man,\" recalled Subol Soren, 48, a resident of Khamar Mokimpur village. Retired schoolteacher Jiten Chandra Acharya, 84, on whose land the family lives, said, \"Pradip was honest despite his poverty. But villagers here are themselves too poor to help his family.\" \"Now, the Robidas family faces not only the trauma of losing a father and husband but also the crushing burden of poverty. In their home, where once a Pradip (lamp) glowed, there is only darkness,\" he added. On the night of August 9, Pradip was travelling with his relative Ruplal Robidas on a rickshaw van in Rangpur's Taraganj upazila. Ruplal, 45, was on his way home to begin planning his daughter's wedding, while Pradip, was driving the van. Around 9:30pm, in the Burtirhat area, a mob stopped them, accusing them of stealing the van. Despite their pleas and explanations, the crowd turned violent and beat them severely. Ruplal died at Taraganj Upazila Health Complex, while Pradip succumbed to his injuries early the next day at Rangpur Medical College Hospital. A case was later filed against 500–700 unidentified people, and police say they are investigating the incident. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Has the interim govt lost its path, Debapriya questions",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Debapriya Bhattacharya, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), today said that a severe storm is now sweeping across Bangladesh and this is being felt in every sphere of economic, political, cultural, and social life. \"When a storm comes, people try to protect their most valuable assets. In my view, the greatest asset of Bangladesh right now is the anti-discrimination spirit we achieved through the July mass uprising, and the public aspirations to see that spirit fulfilled,\" he said. Debapriya made the remarks this morning at a citizens' dialogue held in a hotel in Dhaka city. At the event, a new platform called \"Bangladesh Reform Watch\" was launched officially. The Citizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh has organised the event. He further said, \"In the coming days, the biggest task will be to establish this anti-discrimination spirit in the state, society, and politics of Bangladesh.\" He, however, questioned why the government's reform process has not progressed. He said, \"In the committees and commissions formed by the government, there was not enough representation of marginalised groups, minorities, and disadvantaged people. And finally, we saw discussions held mostly with political figures, but ordinary people's participation was not ensured. As a result, the reform proposals prepared by these committees and commissions could not move forward.\" \"Did this happen due to a lack of ambition? A lack of competence? A lack of capacity? Or was there some larger conflict of interest hidden within it? This question is now in front of us,\" he asked. On the role of the interim government, he said, \"At some points, it seems the interim government has lost its way. Various political events and the preparations for elections are raising that question in our minds.\" Emphasising the role of citizens, Debapriya said, \"Governments come and go, but the people remain, and the country remains. Many may offer technical solutions, but for implementation, public demand for accountability is essential.\" \"If we cannot generate that demand, then blaming others will not help. That is why the voices of citizens, politics, and social movements must come together,\" he added. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Punjab floods washed away thousands of villages and farms; now the devastation threatens Pakistan's economy",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Across the fertile plains of Pakistan's Punjab, families are struggling to rebuild their lives after the worst flooding in decades swept away homes, destroyed crops, and drowned livestock. \"Thirteen of my 15 acres are gone,\" said Muhammad Amjad, 45, a rice and potato farmer in Chiniot, as he stood by submerged fields. \"Our rice is completely destroyed. Women and children have evacuated. Men are left guarding what remains.\" The provincial disaster management authority said more than two million people have been affected, with more than 2,000 villages inundated. Approximately 760,000 people and 516,000 animals have been evacuated, and at least 33 people have died in less than a week. Amish Sultan, 50, lost his only source of income. \"I have 10 buffaloes. They're so weak there's no milk left for my children, let alone to sell. I used to earn 100,000 to 150,000 rupees a month. That stability is gone.\" Farm labourer Mehdi Hassan, 40, said entire neighbourhoods were washed away. \"My home is completely destroyed. We've been left on the roadside with whatever we could carry. We tried to build our own dams but the water still took everything.\" Officials say the floods are the worst in decades, with major dams near capacity, and more rain is forecast. BUMPER TO BUST Farmers and exporters warn the impact on agriculture will be staggering. Rice, sugarcane, maize, vegetables, and cotton fields across Punjab are under water. \"We were expecting a bumper rice crop this year,\" said Ibrahim Shafiq, export manager at Latif Rice Mills. \"Paddy was forecast to open at 3,200–3,600 rupees per 40kg, but with flood damage, prices could rise to 5,000–5,500. That will push rice prices up for local consumers and make us uncompetitive against India internationally.\" Cotton losses also threaten the textile industry, which makes up more than half of Pakistan's exports, at a time when the country faces a 19% U.S. tariff in its biggest market. Agriculture technology firm Farmdar said the damage is likely to be exponential, given the vast stretches of farmland along the rivers now under water. Ghasharib Shoukat, co-founder of commodities platform Zarai Mandi warned wheat, vegetable, and cotton shortages would ripple through supply chains, hurting exports and household budgets. The disaster comes at a sensitive moment for Pakistan's fragile economy. Inflation had cooled to 4.1% in July from 11.1% a year earlier, and food inflation, which spiked above 50% in 2023, had eased. Officials now expect the August inflation reading, due Monday, to come in at 4–5%, with food shortages already driving prices higher. Analysts say delayed wheat sowing, shrinking rice exports and the need to import cotton will deepen the pressure. TENTS NOW, TOMORROW UNKNOWN The destruction extends beyond fields. In Lahore, 38-year-old rickshaw driver Aslam said he waded through six feet (two metres) of water to pull his three-wheeler vehicle to safety. \"I've lived near the Ravi all my life and it never flooded my home before. This time it came inside in hours. If I hadn't saved my rickshaw, we would have lost everything. It is my only livelihood,\" said Aslam, who is now living in a relief tent. A muddy tent city has been erected near the Ravi River, where families huddle under tarpaulins and tents, some beside foul-smelling drains. About 150 to 200 camps have been set up for the displaced just in that area, said Dr. Ijaz Nazeer of Al Khidmat Foundation. Each tent is home to around five to eight people. With three of Pakistan's main rivers in flood, authorities in the Punjab have set up 511 relief camps, 351 medical sites, and 321 veterinary facilities, evacuating nearly 481,000 people and 405,000 animals so far. More than 15,000 police officers have been deployed as monsoon rains continue. Farmers and experts warn the cost of recovery will run into billions of rupees to rebuild homes and re-establish farms. Farmer and activist Aamer Hayat Bhandara said unless the recovery is supported, food insecurity will deepen. \"Farmers grow the food that sustains us all. If they are left alone in times of disaster, the whole nation will suffer,\" he said. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The medical board took the decision considering Nur's progress, Brig Gen Md Asaduzzaman, director of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, told reporters around 11:30am. \"His condition is getting better… the heads of different departments [members of the board] are monitoring him round the clock,\" he said. It may take four to six weeks for the fractures in nose and jaw bones to heal. The blood clot in his eye is expected to recover within one to two weeks, the director said. Nur has been advised to take normal food, but he feels pain while eating, which doctors said will gradually subside. Asaduzzaman also said some blood entered Nur's airway during the nosebleed after the attack. He coughed up blood twice yesterday, but there is no reason to worry about it. Nur is in intensive care following a head injury, along with fractures to his jaw and nose, and has also suffered internal bleeding in the brain.

The clashes between students and locals occurred immediately after the announcement of the Cucsu election date, the VC said at a press conference last night following an emergency meeting of the university administration. \"We have not yet formed a probe committee. We did not receive any assistance from Hathazari Police Station. However, the army, Rab, intelligence agencies, and BGB responded much later,\" the vice chancellor told journalists. He added that no case had yet been filed by the university administration, with a decision expected today. At the emergency meeting, the administration announced that all classes and examinations at the university would remain suspended today. Section 144 will remain in force on the campus until further notice. The university halls will be opened to provide safe accommodation for the students, living in messes nearby Gate no. 2. The university will also bear the medical expenses of the injured. A probe committee will be constituted to investigate the incident and measures will be taken to recover looted weapons from Jobra, it added. It also formed a 21-member committee to improve long-term relations between CU and residents of the Jobra-Fatepur area, with Pro-Vice Chancellor (Administration) Professor Kamal Uddin as convener. The first meeting of the committee is scheduled for 1:00pm today. Pro-Vice Chancellor Professor Shamim Uddin said the administration had attempted to resolve the issue peacefully, but tensions escalated due to the involvement of locals. \"The situation went out of control. Later, with the assistance of the army, Rab, and police, it was brought under control before evening,\" he said. The meeting was attended by representatives of student organisations, senior CU officials, members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and local leaders. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Since morning, many were seen leaving the halls and taking auto-rickshaws to Patgudam Bus Stand to travel home. Most male students, however, refused to leave. Wielding sticks, they brought out processions on campus in the morning. Female students said the sudden shutdown put them in a difficult situation as many live far from campus. Still, fearing for their safety, they chose to leave. \"We came here to study, not for violence or vandalism. Attacks on ordinary students by outsiders cannot be tolerated,\" one of them said. The protesting male students, however, declared, \"We will not leave the halls. The combined degree must be implemented. The vice-chancellor must apologise for the attack on students. Those involved, including teachers must be brought to justice, and the proctorial body must resign.\" The university was declared closed indefinitely following an emergency syndicate meeting held online at 9:30pm. Students were instructed to vacate the halls by 9:00am. Mymensingh Superintendent of Police Kazi Akhtarul Alam said law enforcers have been deployed in and around the campus and remain on alert to prevent any untoward incident. BAU was declared closed indefinitely last night after alleged outsiders attacked protesting students who had confined over 200 teachers, including the vice-chancellor, during an academic council meeting convened to discuss the students' demand for a single combined degree. At least seven students were injured in the attack. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Russian President Vladimir Putin, after talking with China's Xi Jinping and India's Narendra Modi, said on Monday the issue of NATO's eastward enlargement would have to be addressed for there to be sustainable peace in Ukraine. Putin ordered tens of thousands of troops to invade Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops. Russia currently controls a little under one fifth of Ukraine. Ukraine and Western European powers describe the invasion as a brutal imperial-style land grab. Putin casts the war as a battle with a declining West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by enlarging NATO eastwards. On the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Tianjin, Modi held Putin's hand as they walked towards Chinese President Xi. All three smiled as they spoke, surrounded by translators. Speaking at the summit, Putin said the West had tried to bring Ukraine into the West's orbit and then sought to entice the former Soviet republic into the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. \"In order for a Ukrainian settlement to be sustainable and long-term, the root causes of the crisis, which I have just mentioned and which I have repeatedly mentioned before, must be eliminated,\" Putin said. \"A fair balance in the security sphere\" must be also restored, Putin said, shorthand for a series of Russian demands about NATO and European security. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO leaders agreed that Ukraine and Georgia would one day become members. Ukraine in 2019 amended its constitution committing to the path of full membership of NATO and the European Union. Reuters reported in May that Putin's conditions for ending the war include a demand that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging NATO eastwards and lift a chunk of sanctions on Russia. Putin said that \"understandings\" he reached with U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit in Alaska in August opened a way to peace in Ukraine, which he would discuss with leaders attending the regional summit in China. \"We highly appreciate the efforts and proposals from China and India aimed at facilitating the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis,\" Putin told the forum. \"The understandings reached at the recent Russia–U.S. meeting in Alaska, I hope, also contribute toward this goal.\" He said he had detailed to Xi on Sunday the achievements of his talks with Trump and the work \"already underway\" to resolve the conflict and would provide more detail in two-way meetings with the Chinese leader and others. China and India are by far the biggest purchasers of crude from Russia, the world's second largest exporter. Trump has imposed additional tariffs on India over the purchases but there is no sign yet that either India or China are going to stop purchasing Russian oil, a key export of Russia's war economy. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, comprising China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus, is touted as a non-Western style of collaboration and seeks to be an alternative to traditional alliances. Xi told the SCO leaders, including Russian and Belarusian presidents Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko, that the global international situation was becoming more \"chaotic and intertwined\". The Chinese leader also slammed \"bullying behaviour\" from certain countries -- a veiled reference to the United States. \"The security and development tasks facing member states have become even more challenging,\" he added in his address to all the gathered dignitaries in the northern port city of Tianjin. \"Looking to the future, with the world undergoing turbulence and transformation, we must continue to follow the Shanghai spirit... and better perform the functions of the organisation,\" Xi said. Leaders from the ten SCO countries including Putin, Lukashenko and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived earlier on a red carpet and posed for a group photo. Xi, Putin and Modi were seen chatting on live footage, the three leaders flanked by their official translators. The SCO summit, which also involves 16 more countries as observers or \"dialogue partners\", kicked off on Sunday, days before a massive military parade in the capital Beijing to mark 80 years since the end of World War II. - Putin, Modi - Putin touched down in Tianjin on Sunday with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives. Xi held a flurry of back-to-back bilateral meetings with leaders including Lukashenko -- one of Putin's staunch allies -- and Modi who is on his first visit to China since 2018. Modi told Xi that India was committed to taking \"forward our ties on the basis of mutual trust, dignity and sensitivity\". The two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020. A thaw began last October, when Modi met with Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia. Their rapprochement deepened as US President Donald Trump pressured both Asian economic giants with trade tariffs. - 'Mutual benefit' - China and Russia have sometimes promoted the SCO as an alternative to organisations like NATO. This year's summit is the first since Trump returned to the White House. Official posters promoting the SCO lined Tianjin's streets, displaying words such as \"mutual benefit\" and \"equality\" written in Chinese and Russian. More than 20 leaders including Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan are attending the bloc's largest meeting since its founding in 2001. Putin is expected to hold talks on Monday with Erdogan and Pezeshkian about the Ukraine conflict and Tehran's nuclear programme respectively. Many of the assembled dignitaries will be in Beijing on Wednesday to witness the military parade, which will also be attended by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Israel is considering annexation in the occupied West Bank as a possible response to France and other countries recognising a Palestinian state, according to three Israeli officials and the idea will be discussed further on Sunday, another official said. Extension of Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank - de facto annexation of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war - was on the agenda for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet meeting late on Sunday that is expected to focus on the Gaza war, a member of the small circle of ministers said. It is unclear where precisely any such measure would be applied and when, whether only in Israeli settlements or some of them, or in specific areas of the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and whether any concrete steps, which would likely entail a lengthy legislative process, would follow discussions. Any step toward annexation in the West Bank would likely draw widespread condemnation from the Palestinians, who seek the territory for a future state, as well as Arab and Western countries. It is unclear where US President Donald Trump stands on the matter. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar did not respond to a request for comment on whether Saar had discussed the move with his US counterpart Marco Rubio during his visit to Washington last week. Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the prime minister supports annexation and if so, where. A past pledge by Netanyahu to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley was scrapped in 2020 in favour of normalising ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by Trump in his first term in office. The office of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States said on Friday it would not allow Abbas to travel to New York for the United Nations gathering of world leaders, where several US allies are set to recognise Palestine as a state. PLEDGES TO RECOGNISE PALESTINE Israel, which is facing mounting international criticism over the war in Gaza, is angered by pledges by France, Britain, Australia and Canada to formally recognize a Palestinian state at a summit during the U.N. General Assembly in September. The United Nations' highest court in 2024 said that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, and its settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Israel argues the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory. Its annexations of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights decades ago have not won international recognition. Members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition have been calling for years for Israel to formally annex parts of the West Bank, territory, to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Shanghai Cooperation Organisation members to leverage their \"mega-scale market\" on Monday, while unveiling his ambition for a new global security and economic order that poses a challenge to the United States. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has set a model for a new type of international relations, Xi said in opening remarks addressing more than 20 world leaders at a two-day summit held in northern China's port city Tianjin. \"We should advocate for equal and orderly multipolarisation of the world, inclusive economic globalisation and promote the construction of a more just and equitable global governance system,\" he said. China will provide 2 billion yuan ($280 million) of free aid to member states this year and a further 10 billion yuan of loans to a SCO banking consortium, he added. \"We must take advantage of the mega-scale market... to improve the level of trade and investment facilitation,\" said Xi, urging the bloc to boost cooperation in fields including energy, infrastructure, science and technology, and artificial intelligence. Russia's Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia attended the opening ceremony in a major show of Global South solidarity. The security-focused bloc, which began as a group of six Eurasian nations, has expanded to 10 permanent members and 16 dialogue and observer countries in recent years. Xi also called on organisation partners to \"oppose Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation\" and to support multilateral trade systems, an apparent dig at U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war which has disproportionately affected developing economies such as India, whose exports were hit with a 50% levy last week. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said China played a \"fundamental\" role in upholding global multilateralism on Sunday. Analysts say China will use this year's largest-ever summit to demonstrate an alternative vision of global governance to the American-led international order at a time of erratic policymaking, a U.S. retreat from multilateral organisations and geopolitical flux. Beijing has also used the summit as an opportunity to mend ties with New Delhi. Modi, who is in China on his first visit in seven years, and Xi both agreed on Sunday their countries are development partners, not rivals, and discussed ways to improve trade ties amid the global tariff uncertainty. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer A US court on Sunday blocked the government from deporting hundreds of Guatemalan children in a blow to President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on migrants. More than 600 unaccompanied minors living in the United States were facing deportation to Guatemala under a pilot program negotiated with the Central American country, a court filing said. But Sunday's ruling, which followed an emergency complaint by a migrant rights group, temporarily halted their removal for at least 14 days. The National Immigration Law Center had criticized the Trump administration's move, accusing it of having \"ripped vulnerable, frightened children from their beds and attempted to return them to danger\" during the Labor Day holiday weekend. \"We are heartened the Court prevented this injustice from occurring before hundreds of children suffered irreparable harm,\" Efren Olivares, a vice president at the NILC, said in a statement. The group filed a class action suit on behalf of hundreds of Guatemalan children whom it said were at \"imminent risk of unlawful removal from the United States.\" It claimed the government's actions were \"exposing children to multiple harms in returning them to a country where they fear persecution and by flouting their legal obligations to care for them in the United States.\" The ruling marks another legal setback for Trump, who came to office in January with a promise of leading the largest deportation program in history, targeting millions of undocumented migrants. On Friday, a US judge blocked the Trump administration from massively expanding a procedure that allows authorities to swiftly deport migrants without a court hearing. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The deadly protests, which began last week over financial perks for lawmakers, have forced President Prabowo Subianto to make a U-turn over the measures. Demonstrations had began peacefully, but turned violent against the nation's elite paramilitary police unit after footage showed one of its teams running over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan late Thursday. Protests have since spread from capital Jakarta to other major cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province, in the worst unrest since Prabowo took power. More gatherings of students and protesters were planned in several locations around Indonesia's vast archipelago on Monday. Police set up checkpoints across capital Jakarta on Monday, and a police spokesman told broadcaster Kompas TV that officers were also patrolling the city to \"protect\" citizens and give a sense of security. Police had deployed a convoy of armoured cars and motorbikes to parliament late Sunday, in a show of force as they attempt to warn off protesters. The crisis has forced Prabowo to cancel a planned trip to China this week for a military parade commemorating the end of World War II. His close ally Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin warned Sunday that military and police would take \"firm action\" against \"rioters and looters\", after the finance minister's house was pillaged. At least three people were killed after a fire Friday started by protesters at a council building in the eastern city of Makassar. Another victim died in Makassar on Friday after he was beaten by a mob on suspicion that he was an intelligence officer, local disaster agency official Muhammad Fadli Tahar told AFP on Sunday. In Yogyakarta the Amikom Yogyakarta University confirmed the death of its student Rheza Sendy Pratama in protests, but the circumstances around his death remain unclear. In anticipation of further unrest, TikTok on Saturday temporarily suspended its live feature for \"a few days\" in Indonesia, where it has more than 100 million users. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

Spanish second seed Alcaraz, the 2022 champion, stayed on course for a semi-final showdown against Novak Djokovic after overpowering France's Arthur Rinderknech in straight sets. The 22-year-old five-time Grand Slam champion was made to work hard in a hard-fought first set but eventually pulled away to win 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 6-4 on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. \"I think my style of tennis suits pretty well the energy here in New York,\" said Alcaraz, who has yet to drop a set at the tournament. \"The energy is special playing the day session, playing the night session. It doesn't matter, people are always there. I love it and I think that's why I play my best tennis here,\" he added. The win moves Alcaraz a step closer to a potential last four assignment with tennis icon Djokovic. Djokovic, 38, continues his latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title later Sunday in a night match against unseeded German Jan-Lennard Struff. Alcaraz will face Czech 20th seed Jiri Lehecka in the quarter-finals on Tuesday. Lehecka reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for only the second time after battling past veteran Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, winning 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, 2-6, 6-2. \"I'm a bit speechless because it's been a hell of a match,\" said Lehecka, who is poised to crack the top 20 after matching his quarter-final run at the 2023 Australian Open. \"Definitely an unbelievable week and a half for me. I've been playing well,\" he said. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer With less than a month until the start of the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025, the International Cricket Council has announced a staggering increase in the prize money for the tournament set to be staged in India and Sri Lanka. The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million (US Dollars) -- a monumental rise of 297 percent from $3.5 million at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022. The total prize pot eclipses that at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup from two years ago in India, which had total prize money of $10 million. The announcement aligns with the ICC's strategy to amplify the growth of women's cricket and a decision to introduce pay parity was announced ahead of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024. The winners of the 13th edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup will receive prize money of $4.48 million -- a 239 per cent increase from the $1.32 million awarded to Australia in 2022. Meanwhile, the runners-up will receive $2.24 million, an increase of 273 per cent in comparison to the $600,000 England won three years ago. The two losing semifinalists will take home $1.12 million (up from $300,000 in 2022) each. Each group stage participant is guaranteed to earn $250,000 while each group-stage win will get the victors $34,314. In the second half of the final table, the teams finishing fifth and sixth will take home $700,000 each and those in seventh and eighth place will earn $280,000. The 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup will commence on September 30 with India and Sri Lanka facing off in the opening game in Guwahati. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Grassroots football in Jerrabomberra, Australia, has been forced into an unusual timeout after a protected plover laid an egg in the middle of the pitch. Players arriving for their weekend match at the Jerrabomberra Regional Sports Complex, 20 minutes from Canberra, were told to shift to another field when the egg was found on the centre circle. The Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council confirmed that, following advice from local wildlife service Wildcare, the field could remain closed for up to 28 days while the egg incubates. Moving it is not an option, as plovers are a protected species and known for fiercely defending their nests by swooping at intruders. \"We must be proactive in protecting native species. If moving the egg is necessary, specialists will be engaged and permissions sought,\" a council spokesperson said. Authorities praised the local football clubs for their cooperation in relocating games and training to nearby fields. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer The Seattle Sounders stunned Lionel Messi and Inter Miami 3-0 on Sunday to win the Leagues Cup, completing their collection of North American trophies in front of a record crowd at Lumen Field. Osaze De Rosario scored in the 26th minute and Alex Roldan added a penalty in the second half before Paul Rothrock capped the scoring for the Sounders, whose determined defense stymied a star-studded Inter lineup led by Argentine icon Messi. Inter's frustrations spilled over at the final whistle and officials had to scramble to quell a brewing brawl before the Sounders -- whose $16.7 million payroll is dwarfed by Miami's $46.8 million player compensation total -- could celebrate their first Leagues Cup title. They became the first Major League Soccer team to win every North American Trophy on offer. They already own two MLS Cup crowns, an MLS Supporters Shield, four US Open Cups and a CONCACAF Champions Cup. The latest triumph came before an announced crowd of 69,314 -- shattering the previous record for a Leagues Cup crowd of 50,675. It was also a record for a Sounders game at Lumen Field, beating the 69,274 they drew for the 2019 MLS Cup final against Toronto. De Rosario put the Sounders in front in the 26th minute, heading in a cross from Roldan. De Rosario had electrified the largely green-clad crowd when he came close in the third minute with a header saved by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari. It was a frustrating first half for Inter in the face of Seattle's physical defense, with Obed Vargas a particular thorn in Messi's side. Inter's first opportunity inside the box saw Messi take a quick tumble after tangling with Seattle defender Vargas. Seattle's Jackson Ragen blocked Messi's attempt from outside the area in the 19th minute then a minute later blocked a shot from Rodrigo De Paul. Ragen was there again as Miami came up empty in a chaotic sequence in front of the goal after a corner kick taken by Messi in the 31st minute. Seattle almost doubled their lead in the 40th, but Jesus Ferreira's long-range shot caromed off the right post. A reorganized Miami were pressing early in the second half and appeared to have every chance of pulling off the kind of comeback win they posted over Orlando in the semi-finals. Luis Suarez spun through traffic to deliver the ball to Messi as he cut in front of the goal, but Messi chipped his attempt over the crossbar. Miami were finding their rhythm, but they squandered another golden opportunity in the 60th minute when Tadeo Allende, fed by Suarez, missed wide from directly in front of the net. Miami appeared to have seized the momentum, but Seattle wouldn't let go. The Sounders nearly doubled the score in the 69th minute, but Vargas's right-footed blast from outside the box was blocked by Maximiliano Falcon. Four minutes later, Rothrock got loose and forced a save from Ustari. Sounders clinch late Roldan's penalty in the 84th minute gave Seattle some breathing room, the referee awarding the penalty after Miami's Yannik Bright dived at the feet of substitute Georgi Minoungou. Rothrock put the finishing touches on the win with an angled shot past Ustari in the 89th to spark the Sounders celebrations. Both finalists in the cross-border tournament featuring teams from MLS and Liga-MX clubs were already assured of berths in the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup. The victory earned Seattle direct entry to the round of 16 in the regional tournament that will decide one 2029 FIFA Club World Cup berth. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Premier League champions Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee, media reports said Monday. The Swedish forward is set to join the Reds in a deal worth about £130 million ($176 million), according to reports by The Athletic and The Telegraph, among other outlets. The Athletic reported that Isak will undergo a medical on Monday before completing a six-year deal with the Merseyside club. The fee will set a new Premier League transfer record, exceeding the £106 million that Chelsea paid Benfica for Enzo Fernandez in 2023, the reports said. Isak, 25, scored 23 goals in the Premier League last season -- behind only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah -- as Newcastle qualified for the Champions League. He has been the subject of a protracted and acrimonious transfer saga this summer, training away from the rest of the Newcastle squad after making clear his desire to move to Liverpool. Newcastle reportedly rejected an initial £110 million bid for Isak earlier this summer. But the deal edged closer after the Magpies signed German international striker Nick Woltemade on Saturday for a club-record fee reported to be worth up to £69 million. Isak will become the latest blockbuster acquisition in a lavish summer spending spree by Liverpool, who also brought in German midfielder Florian Wirtz in another massive deal. The Reds have also signed French attacker Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt, Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen and Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe had hinted for the first time on Friday he might be open to allowing Isak to leave because of the impact a sale would have on Newcastle's profit and sustainability calculations. The northeast club were forced to sell Elliot Anderson and Yankuba Minteh last year in order to avoid a points deduction, and a sizeable return on their investment in Isak would ease any Profit and Sustainability Regulations concerns. Despite the influx of new talent Liverpool have not so far looked like the relentless team that strolled to the Premier League title last season with four games to spare. But they still top the table with three wins from three after dispatching last year's runners-up, Arsenal, 1-0 at Anfield on Sunday. Newcastle sit 17th in the early running after a 0-0 stalemate against Leeds United. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Champions Barcelona dropped their first points of the La Liga season with a 1-1 draw at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. The Catalan giants had goalkeeper Joan Garcia to thank for earning them that as he made several fine saves on a testing night in the Spanish capital. Barca took the lead through a contested Lamine Yamal penalty, at a time in the match VAR was not working, but Fran Perez levelled after the break for the hosts, who could have gone on to win. After leaders Real Madrid won their third game on Saturday and Athletic Bilbao followed suit earlier on Sunday, Barcelona are fourth and trail the leaders by two points. \"We didn't deserve more -- in the end we had a fantastic goalkeeper,\" said Barca coach Hansi Flick. \"We made too many mistakes, too many errors and this is why they come back and this was not a good match for us.\" Barca's teenage star Yamal said his team had to come back strongly in a fortnight when La Liga resumes. \"We have to learn from this after the international break, and come back with the intensity that we had last year, and start to win every time we can,\" Yamal told DAZN. Flick shuffled his pack, bringing Dani Olmo and Andreas Christensen into the starting line-up among several changes, with Marcus Rashford dropping to the bench. Garcia, who arrived from neighbours Espanyol this summer, made a superb save to thwart Andrei Ratiu early on. Even though Rayo's pitch at their humble Vallecas stadium was dry and scruffy, the game flew end-to-end in entertaining fashion. Barca took the lead in the 40th minute from the spot as 18-year-old Yamal sent Augusto Batalla the wrong way, although Rayo were unhappy with how the Spain international won the penalty. Yamal fell after a collision with Pep Chavarria in the area, which Rayo felt the teenage winger forced, and to make matters worse because of technical difficulties the referee could not communicate with his VAR colleagues over a potential review. Rayo coach Inigo Perez said he would not blame the referee but was upset with the \"inefficiency\". Dani Olmo should have doubled Barca's lead before half-time but fired over the bar after Batalla pushed the ball back into his path, with the goal gaping. Barca stopper Garcia, having a superb night, denied Isi Palazon early in the second half before Rayo levelled. After a corner found its way past those in the middle Perez slammed home off the bar. Garcia made an excellent save from Jorge de Frutos as the forward ran through on goal and then again from Palazon after 85 minutes. Ratiu turned home after Rayo kept the chance alive but it was disallowed for offside. \"We totally (could have won), we controlled the game,\" said Palazon. \"It didn't happen for us, we had so many chances... but we have to be happy with the work we put in today.\" Defensive struggles Barcelona left with a point, largely thanks to the superb work of goalkeeper Garcia, as despite Flick's changes they showed the same defensive deficiencies on show during last weekend's comeback win at Levante. \"We're working (on our high defensive line) but I don't think that's the reason we conceded -- the goal came from a set piece,\" added Yamal. \"We have to continue with our game and our ideas until the end, and try to win.\" Earlier Athletic Bilbao won 2-1 at Real Betis to pull level with Real Madrid as the only teams still boasting a 100-percent record. Marc Bartra deflected a cross into his own net before Aitor Paredes pounced for Athletic's second, as the Basque side won their third match in a row to maintain their perfect start. Cedric Bakambu nodded home in stoppage time to give Betis brief hope at La Cartuja stadium in Seville, where they are playing while their Benito Villamarin home is redeveloped, but they could not find a late leveller. Third-place Villarreal were held to a 1-1 draw by Celta Vigo as the Yellow Submarine dropped their first points of the campaign. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

The 31-year-old enjoys spinning tracks as a DJ and has recently launched his own YouTube channel, where he shares travel vlogs, including experiences from the ongoing Bangladesh tour. On Sunday, however, Max added a new skill to his repertoire -- sports journalism. During teammate Noah Croes' maiden official press conference at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium, ahead of the second T20I against Bangladesh, Max surprised everyone by arriving with a GoPro camera in hand and taking a seat among the journalists. Netherlands media manager Corey Rutgers had informed the press beforehand that Noah was feeling nervous ahead of his first appearance before the media. But Max's impromptu role as a reporter quickly lightened the mood. Not only did he film the entire session, but Max also threw in a few cheeky questions for his teammate, asking about the story behind Noah's nickname, \"Tonker,\" and his favourite Bangladeshi cricketer. Noah, smiling at Max's effort, revealed that Mustafizur Rahman topped his list. \"It's a good one, Maxi,\" he said. \"There are a number of honourable mentions, but it's hard to go past Mustafizur. Facing him at the 2024 T20 World Cup was a really cool experience.\" As the conference went on, Noah appeared to overcome his initial nervousness. When asked how Max performed in his new role as a journalist, he quipped: \"I think he's got a career there. He's very good. The social media side, he's going to be there post-career for sure.\" Noah ended the session by expressing appreciation for the warm reception in Bangladesh: \"It's definitely something different. It's great to see how passionate people here are about cricket. We love playing for you guys, and it's been such a great experience. Can't wait for the next two games.\" ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

City striker Erling Haaland marked his 100th Premier League appearance with his 88th goal in the competition since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2022. But the 25-year-old's third goal this season wasn't enough to help Pep Guardiola's side bounce back from last weekend's 2-0 home defeat against Tottenham. James Milner's second half penalty hauled Brighton level before Brajan Gruda's late strike completed City's collapse. Spain midfielder Rodri made his first league start for City since suffering a serious knee injury against Arsenal in September 2024. But Ballon d'Or holder Rodri, who had also started a Club World Cup match in the summer, was unable to inspire City to their second win of the season. Haaland should have given City an early lead after racing clean through, but he scuffed a tame shot straight at Bart Verbruggen. He also lashed just wide from 18 yards after a flowing City move. The Norway striker missed another chance with a weak header from Rayan Ait-Nouri's cross, allowing Verbruggen the chance to claw it to safety. Haaland persevered and finally pierced the Brighton defence in the 34th minute, stabbing past Verbruggen from close-range after Omar Marmoush prodded the ball into his path. Haaland forced Verbruggen into a miscued clearance just before half-time, but Rodri blazed the chance over. Matheus Nunes handed Brighton a lifeline in the 67th minute. Lewis Dunk shrugged off Bernardo Silva's attempt to mark him and blasted a shot that Nunes blocked with his arm away from his body. Milner sent James Trafford the wrong way with a clinical penalty before copying Diogo Jota's goal celebration in tribute to his former Liverpool team-mate who died in a car crash in July. It was the 39-year-old's first Premier League goal since 2019, making him the second oldest scorer in the competition's history behind Teddy Sheringham, who was 40 when he set the record. City were in disarray and German youngster Gruda made them pay in the 89th minute, breaking into the area before delivering a composed finish to spark wild celebrations as Guardiola looked on in disbelief. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "title": "Szoboszlai scores stunner as Liverpool beat Arsenal in clash of title contenders",
    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick gave Liverpool first blood against Arsenal with a 1-0 win in Sunday's battle between the Premier League title favourites. A tense tussle at Anfield looked set to end in a stalemate until the Hungarian's 83rd-minute strike ensured the defending champions remain the only side with a perfect record from the opening three games. In all three matches, Arne Slot's men have scored late winners, also overcoming Bournemouth and Newcastle in dramatic fashion. Liverpool may still be a work in progress after overhauling the squad that romped to the title last season. But they remain the team to beat thanks to an abundance of attacking talent capable of match-winning moments like the one Szoboszlai produced. Liverpool could even be stronger come the end of the transfer window on Monday as they look to add Newcastle's unsettled striker Alexander Isak and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi to bolster thier defence. Arsenal have backed Mikel Arteta with over £250 million ($338 million) worth of new signings in a bid to usurp the Reds and win the Gunners' first Premier League title since 2004. The visitors were hampered by the absence of the injured Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz. But Viktor Gyokeres did little to silence doubts that he can make the step up from a prolific spell at Sporting Lisbon to the Premier League. The Swede was easily marshalled by Virgil van Dijk. To add to the Gunners injury woes, William Saliba went off inside the opening five minutes, replaced by Christhian Mosquera. The Spanish under-21 international is yet to make a Premier League start but was not seriously tested as Liverpool's new-look attack struggled to click into gear. Despite defensive issues this season, Slot again named a front four of club record signing Florian Wirtz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike. At Arsenal, Noni Madueke's arrival was not met with enthusiasm by fans who even started a petition to block the England international's £48.5 million move from Chelsea. Deputising for Saka on the right wing, Madueke was by fair the visitors biggest threat. Milos Kerkez has had a difficult start to his Liverpool career and was consistently beaten for pace by Madueke, who lacked the finishing touch. A desperate Kerkez challenge deflected Madueke's strike over with the best effort of a disjointed first half. The second half followed the same cagey pattern with both sides wary of risking a damaging early defeat in the title race. Liverpool did have the ball in the net on the hour only to be denied by the offside flag. David Raya breathed a sigh of relief after he failed to hold Wirtz's effort and then tripped Gakpo before Ekitike forced the ball in. Psychological blow However, Gakpo had strayed offside before collecting the rebound. That excitement did at least bring the Anfield crowd to life to inspire a late Liverpool push for all three points. Arsenal had not conceded this season and it took something special to break down Arteta's men. Szoboszlai's free-kick dipped and curled perfectly in off the Raya's right-hand post to leave the Spaniard helpless. Arsenal had a penalty shout waved away for Joe Gomez's challenge on Eberechi Eze in their pursuit of an equaliser. Liverpool stood strong to register their first clean sheet of the season and land an early psychological blow in the title race. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",

    "content": "Fresh clash erupts between CU students, locals US national found dead at Westin Dhaka 'Apply same decision to Jatiya Party as Awami League' CU students, locals clash over assault on female peer Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson has stayed in Germany in a bid to revive his aborted loan move to Bayern Munich after the deal was called off at the last minute. Jackson flew to Munich on Saturday to seal his season-long switch to the Bundesliga champions, only to be told the move had to be aborted due to Chelsea's injury problems. Blues striker Liam Delap will be sidelined for up to eight weeks after suffering a hamstring problem in Saturday's win over Fulham, while England forward Cole Palmer is also out due to a groin injury. With Christopher Nkunku having joined AC Milan this week, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca would be left with Joao Pedro as his only fit senior striker if Jackson were allowed to leave. Speaking after a 3-2 win at Augsburg on Saturday, Bayern sporting director Max Eberl confirmed that the deal was off. \"Chelsea informed us that they would like the player back after we agreed yesterday,\" he said. \"The situation now is that the lad is here in Munich, but we are sending him back.\" But Jackson, 24, was angry with Chelsea's late change of plans and opted against leaving Germany on Sunday while his representatives work to resolve the stand-off. Jackson's agent Diomansy Kamara had insisted on social media that his player was not returning to Chelsea. \"We're not going back. The plane doesn't go backwards: Munich,\" he said. And on Sunday, Kamara, speaking at a hotel in Munich, told German newspaper Bild: \"We're still hoping it will work. \"If we didn't have hope, we wouldn't still be here anymore!\" Meanwhile, Chelsea are reportedly exploring a move for Sporting Lisbon's Conrad Harder before Monday's transfer deadline, which could open the way for Jackson to join Bayern after all. Chelsea are reported to prefer selling Jackson on a permanent basis rather than reviving a loan deal. Earlier on Saturday, a deal had been agreed that would have seen the Senegal striker move for an initial £13 million (15 million euros) loan fee with an option for Bayern to make the deal permanent for £52 million. Jackson, who has not played for Chelsea this season, had been told that he was not a part of Maresca's plans following the signings of Delap from Ipswich and Joao Pedro from Brighton. Jackson has endured a turbulent time at Chelsea since joining from Villarreal two years ago, with criticism of his erratic finishing marring his spell in west London. ‘এখন আমাদের সামনে চ্যালেঞ্জ হচ্ছে, আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারির নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠুভাবে করতে সর্বতোভাবে সহযোগিতা করা।'",
