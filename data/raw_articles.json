    "title": "DUCSU polls: Chief returning officer clarifies stance on army deployment",
    "content": "The chief returning officer of Dhaka University Central Student Union (DUCSU) elections, Professor Mohammad Jasim Uddin, has clarified their stance regarding army deployment in the polls. He said that assistance from the army would be sought to protect election security, if needed. However, there is currently no reason for any security concern. Professor Jasim Uddin made these remarks while speaking to journalists at the Senate Building of the university in front of the returning office around 3:30 pm on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release, “No directive has been given by the government to the Bangladesh Army to take responsibility for these elections (DUCSU and hall unions), and there will be no scope for such involvement in the future.” Replying to a query on the army issue, chief returning officer Jasim Uddin said that army deployment has been considered in their planning. If required, they will request this assistance through the university administration. However, at present, there is no reason for any security concern. Returning officer Kazi Maruful Haque said that the proposal for army deployment arose from students’ demands for round-the-clock security. Their request to move polling centres out of residential halls has been implemented. Maruful Haque further said that a student would take about eight minutes to cast all their votes. Even with 100 per cent voter turnout, booths will be arranged proportionately so that everyone can cast vote. Everyone will be able to cast their vote. There will be no irregularities. There is no concern regarding the election at this moment. Professor Golam Rabbani, head of the Code of Conduct Taskforce, said that at present, there are no banners or festoons on the campus. All have been removed through the proctor’s office. Candidates are allowed to distribute handbills and leaflets, and they are doing so. He further said an allegation of code of conduct violation was received from the Faculty of Fine Arts. A committee has been formed to investigate, and a report will be submitted today. He added that no code of conduct violations have been reported throughout the day. There was an allegation of a candidate announcing their manifesto with music at the Student-Teacher Centre. The candidate was asked to provide an explanation. After receiving a response, the candidate was warned. If such incidents occur again, punitive measures will be taken, Golam Rabbani added.",

    "title": "US visa: Student, journalist visa limits proposed at 4 years, 240 days",
    "content": "The Trump administration aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media, according to a proposed government regulation issued on Wednesday, part of a broader crackdown on legal immigration. President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January. The latest move would create new hurdles for international students, exchange workers and foreign journalists who would have to apply to extend their stay in the US rather than maintain a more flexible legal status. The proposed regulation would create a fixed time period for F visas for international students, J visas that allow visitors on cultural exchange programs to work in the US, and I visas for members of the media. Those visas are currently available for the duration of the program or U.S.-based employment. There were about 1.6 million international students on F visas in the US in 2024, according to US government data. The US granted visas to about 355,000 exchange visitors and 13,000 members of the media in fiscal year 2024, which began on 1 October 2023. The student and exchange visa periods would be no longer than four years, the proposed regulation said. The visa for journalists - which currently can last years - would be up to 240 days or, in the case of Chinese nationals, 90 days. The visa holders could apply for extensions, the proposal said. China's foreign ministry, asked about the proposed new rule for Chinese journalists on Thursday, said it opposed \"the discriminatory practices adopted by the U.S. against specific countries\". The Trump administration said in the proposed regulation that the change was needed to better \"monitor and oversee\" the visa holders while they were in the United States. The public will have 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a proposal put forward in 2020 at the end of Trump's first term in office. NAFSA, a non-profit organization representing international educators at more than 4,300 institutions worldwide, opposed the 2020 proposal and called on the Trump administration to scrap it. The Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden withdrew it in 2021. The Trump administration has increased scrutiny of legal immigration, revoking student visas and green cards of university students over their ideological views and stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of migrants. In an 22 August memo, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would resume long-dormant visits to citizenship applicants' neighbourhoods to check what it termed residency, moral character and commitment to American ideals.",

    "title": "Trump's doubling of tariffs hits India, damaging ties",
    "content": "Additional 25 per cent tariff imposed as punishment for India buying Russian oil. Tariffs of up to 50 per cent threaten Indian exporters and jobs. US President Donald Trump's doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50 per cent took effect as scheduled on Wednesday, delivering a serious blow to ties between two powerful democracies that had in recent decades become strategic partners. A punitive 25 per cent tariff, imposed due to India's purchases of Russian oil, was added to Trump's prior 25 per cent tariff on many imports from the South Asian nation. It takes total duties as high as 50 per cent  for goods as varied as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals - among the highest imposed by the US and roughly on par with Brazil and China. The new tariffs threaten thousands of small exporters and jobs in India, including in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, and are expected to hurt growth in the world's fastest-growing major economy. There was no indication of renewed talks between Washington and New Delhi on Wednesday, after five rounds of talks failed to yield a trade deal to cut US tariff rates to around 15 per cent - like the deals agreed by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. The discussions were marked by miscalculations and missed signals, officials on both sides say. India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But an Indian government source said New Delhi hoped the US would review the extra 25 per cent tariff, adding that the government plans steps to help cushion its impact. There was no Indian market reaction to the move on Wednesday as bourses were closed for a Hindu festival, but on Tuesday equity benchmarks logged their worst session in three months after a Washington notification confirmed the additional tariff. The Indian rupee also continued its losing streak for a fifth consecutive session on Tuesday, ending at its lowest level in three weeks. While the tariff disruption would be bruising, it may not be all gloom and doom for the world's fifth-largest economy if New Delhi can further reform its economy and become less protectionist as it seeks to resolve the crisis with Washington, analysts said. A US Customs and Border Protection notice to shippers, opens new tab provides a three-week exemption for Indian goods that were loaded onto a vessel and in transit to the US before the midnight deadline. Also exempted are steel, aluminum and derivative products, passenger vehicles, copper and other goods subject to separate tariffs of up to 50 per cent under the Section 232 national security trade law. Indian trade ministry officials say the average tariff on US imports is around 7.5 per cent, while the US Trade Representative's office has highlighted rates of up to 100 per cent on autos and an average applied tariff rate of 39 per cent on US farm goods. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said India must simply stop buying Russian oil to reduce US import taxes. \"It's real easy, that India can get 25 per cent off tomorrow if it stops buying Russian oil and helping to feed (Russia's) war machine,\" Navarro told Bloomberg Television. Washington says India's purchase of Russian oil helps fund Moscow's war in Ukraine and that New Delhi also profits from it. India has rejected the accusation as a double standard, pointing to US and European trade links with Russia. China remains a top buyer of Russian oil, but Trump has said he does not immediately need to consider similar extra tariffs on Chinese goods amid a delicate US-China trade truce. Commenting on the punishing levy, India's junior foreign minister Kirti Vardhan Singh told reporters: \"We are taking appropriate steps so that it does not harm our economy, and let me assure you that the strength of our economy will carry us through these times.\" \"Our concern is our energy security, and we will continue to purchase energy sources from whichever country benefits us.\" US-India two-way goods trade totaled USD 129 billion in 2024, with a USD 45.8 billion US trade deficit, according to US Census Bureau data. Exporter groups estimate the tariffs could affect nearly 55 per cent of India's USD 87 billion in merchandise exports to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. Rajeswari Sengupta, an economics professor at Mumbai's Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said allowing the rupee to \"depreciate is one way to provide indirect support to exporters\" and regain lost competitiveness. \"The government should adopt a more trade-oriented, less protectionist strategy to boost demand, which is already slackening,\" she said. Sustained tariffs at this rate could dent India's growing appeal as an alternative manufacturing hub to China for goods such as smartphones and electronics. \"Up to 2 million jobs are at risk in the near term,\" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at the Anand Rathi Group. But he noted th",

    "content": "The Bangladesh Army has received no directive from the government regarding army deployment in the upcoming central student union elections at universities. Moreover, there is no scope for the Bangladesh Army to be involved in such responsibilities in the future. This was stated in a press release issued yesterday, Wednesday, by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The Dhaka University authorities on Tuesday issued a press release stating that there would be a three-tier security arrangement in the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (DUCSU) and hall union elections. Members of the university’s BNCC and the proctorial team would be at the first tier, police at the second tier, and the army would be stationed as a “striking force” at seven entry points of the university at the third tier. That morning, the university authorities issued the press release following a meeting between the chief returning officer and the candidates of the DUCSU and hall union elections at the university’s Senate Bhaban. Regarding strengthening security on the campus, the release said that the police would carry out their duties under the instructions of the returning officers during the election. If necessary, the army would enter the campus. After voting, soldiers would cordon off the polling centres until the announcement of results. No one except authorised persons would be allowed to enter during vote counting. Now, ISPR issued a press release regarding the deployment of the army in the upcoming central student union elections at universities. It said that the Bangladesh Army had taken note of reports in various media and on social media about deployment of the army centering the upcoming elections. The release said the army received no directive from the government to carry out duties in these elections and there is no scope for involvement in such responsibilities in the future. Bangladesh Army believes that with the direct cooperation of the existing law enforcement agencies and under the overall supervision of the university administration, the upcoming central student union elections will be completed in a peaceful and festive environment. On behalf of the Bangladesh Army, best wishes were conveyed to all, it added.",

    "title": "Engineering Rights Movement announces new programmes, ‘Complete shutdown’ to continue",
    "content": "Engineers Rights Movement, a platform of the protesting engineering students, said their ongoing 'complete shutdown' at all public and private universities will continue until further announcement. Platform president Md Wali Ullah made the announcement at a press conference at the Institute of Engineers, Dhaka (IEB) on Thursday afternoon. At the briefing, they also provided a detailed account of the ongoing movement and their demands. During the conference, a video presentation highlighted the disparities between diploma and BSc engineering degree holders. It was pointed out that in many cases, government job positions are reserved solely for diploma holders, leaving BSc engineers without opportunities. This practice needs to be stopped. Wali Ullah said, “Our movement has been going on seeking realisation of three demands, and the massive incident that occurred yesterday, Wednesday needs to be addressed. Although we were given a commitment yesterday, we have seen no implementation today. Therefore, our programme will continue: until the next announcement, complete shutdown will remain in place on campuses across the country.” The protesters also announced departmental conferences this week and a national conference in the following week. They said such programmes were planned to avoid public inconvenience. They, however, would hold a procession today. The engineering students’ demands are as follows: recruitment to the 9th-grade assistant engineer position should be done only through examination and with a minimum qualification of BSc engineering; in the 10th-grade position, where only diploma holders are allowed to apply, higher degree holders should also be eligible; and only those who complete a BSc engineering degree should have the right to write ‘engineer’ after their name. BUET students held sit-in programmes at Shahbagh on Tuesday and Wednesday to press home these three demands. Yesterday, Wednesday, students blocked Shahbagh intersection around 11:00 am as part of a pre-announced programme. At one stage around 1:00pm, they tried to move toward the chief adviser’s residence at Jamuna. Police stopped them near the Intercontinental Hotel, using sound grenades, tear gas shells, and water cannons, also charged-baton on the protesters, injuring many students. After the police charged batons, students blocked Shahbagh intersection from 5:30 pm until 10:30 pm. Last night, they announced the complete shutdown of engineers at all engineering universities across the country.",

The demonstrators also burned the effigy of police officer Masud Alam who is the Deputy Commissioner of Ramna Division of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP). Earlier, the students brought out a procession from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) that paraded different intersections including Shaheed Minar, TSC, Doyel Chattar, Shikkha Bhaban, National Press Club, and High Court. As the procession of protesters were moving towards DMP headquarters, it was intercepted by police at Matsya Bhaban intersection. Barred, the students took position in the street. After around an hour, the protesters left the intersection around 7:30pm. They later took position in front of Engineer’s Institute, halting traffic to Shahbagh. Shahin Al Mohammad Tasrif, a student of BUET’s Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department said, they are demonstrating today to press home a two-point demand. “Firstly, the home adviser and DC Masud have to seek apology and the latter has to be removed. Secondly, the three-point demand of demonstrating engineering students has to be implemented and a gazette has to be issued in this end soon.” On Wednesday, police attacked demonstrators who were pressing for their three-point demands while they were marching to Jamuna, the residence of the Chief Adviser. Many students were injured as the police hurled stun grenades, tear sells and charged batons.",

    "content": "The head of the UN's World Food Programme warned Thursday that famine-hit Gaza is \"at breaking point\", appealing for the urgent revival of its network of 200 food distribution points. \"Enough is enough,\" the WFP's executive director Cindy McCain said after visiting the besieged Palestinian territory, where Israel is pressing operations in its offensive against Hamas. \"Gaza is at a breaking point. Desperation is soaring -- and I saw it firsthand,\" McCain said in a statement. Her comments come less than a week after the United Nations declared a famine in Gaza, blaming the \"systematic obstruction\" of humanitarian deliveries by Israel. McCain went to Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah, where she visited a nutrition clinic keeping children alive and met with displaced mothers who struggle daily to find scraps of food. \"I met starving children receiving treatment for severe malnutrition -- and I saw photos of when they were healthy. Today they are unrecognizable,\" McCain said. \"We must urgently be able to revive our vast and trusted network of 200 food distribution points across the Strip, community kitchens and bakeries. It is urgent that the right conditions are in place so we can reach the most vulnerable and save lives\", she said. McCain met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to press for a \"surge of food assistance to reach the most vulnerable\". She also met Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa in Ramallah, the WFP said. \"What we need is a ceasefire. My heart goes to the mothers in Gaza, as well as to the mothers of the Israeli hostages, whose children are currently starving,\" McCain said. Israel, which is preparing to conquer Gaza City, is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to end its almost two-year campaign. The UN declared a famine in the Gaza governorate last week, but Israel has dismissed the report as \"fabricated\". The Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 62,895 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN considers those figures reliable.",

    "title": "Maternal health needs additional attention in Rangpur",
    "content": "The state of maternal and child healthcare in the Rangpur Division is worse than the national average. Many mothers in the char areas of Rangpur are themselves adolescents, making the situation particularly distressing. Certain remote areas remain extremely difficult to access for healthcare delivery. Without addressing Rangpur, achieving national progress will remain unattainable. Furthermore, healthcare is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; coordinated action from multiple ministries is essential. Collective efforts, along with skilled personnel, infrastructure and dedicated budgetary allocation, must give special consideration to Rangpur. These observations were made yesterday, Wednesday, at a roundtable discussion on ‘Maternal and Newborn health services in Rangpur: Current Status, challenges and things to be done’ held at the Directorate General of Health Services in Mohakhali, Dhaka. The discussion was organised under the ‘Jononi Project’ by ‘Save the Children Bangladesh’, with support from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and in partnership with Prothom Alo as media collaborator. At the outset, Ujjal Kumar Roy, Project Director of Jononi, presented a concept paper. He reported that the neonatal mortality rate in Rangpur stands at 30 per 1,000 live births, compared to the national figure of 20. The child mortality rate is 33 in Rangpur, while nationally it is 25. The maternal mortality rate nationally is 196 per 100,000 live births, whereas in Rangpur it is 223. Child marriage rates are also significantly higher. Nationally, 27 per cent of girls marry below the age of 18, but in Rangpur this rises to 63 per cent. Similarly, 63 per cent of women conceive before the age of 19 in Rangpur, compared with 24 per cent nationally. Births attended by midwife for 70 per cent nationally, while in Rangpur the figure is only 49 per cent. During the discussion, speakers expressed their views on these findings. S M Abdullah Al Murad, Line Director for Maternal, Neo-natal and Child Health at the Directorate General of Health Services, highlighted various government initiatives. He stressed that antenatal care is indispensable for ensuring the health of mothers and newborns. Pointing out the urgent need for action in Rangpur, he emphasised public awareness campaigns, particularly within schools, to address the prevalence of child marriage. Dewan Morshed Kamal, Divisional Director of Family Planning in Rangpur, shared his personal experiences from visiting char areas. He noted that the conditions of many young mothers were harrowing, a 15-year-old carrying a child, with one in her arms and another unborn. Despite attempts at raising awareness, he acknowledged that socio-economic pressures, administrative shortcomings and other barriers hinder prevention efforts. He further observed that there is a lack of connection between Union Health and Family Welfare Centres and Community Clinics, stressing the need for greater coordination. Sohel Habib, Line Director (NCRH) of the Directorate General of Family Planning, identified child marriage as one of the most significant obstacles to improving maternal and neonatal healthcare in Rangpur. He underlined that awareness campaigns must be conducted with administrative support, alongside strong inter-ministerial coordination. Dr Gausul Azim Chowdhury, Divisional Director of Health Services in Rangpur, stated that efforts are being made to increase institutional deliveries and improve antenatal services. He emphasised the need to ensure transport facilities, including ambulances for mothers and to build confidence among adolescents in order to prevent child marriage. Zainal Abedin, Line Director for Hospital Service Management at the Directorate General of Health Services, observed that despite numerous government programmes, questions remain regarding the availability of quality services. Large numbers of people seek care in government hospitals and health centres, necessitating adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower. He suggested the establishment of healthcare centres through public–private partnerships, where the government would provide human resource support and the private sector would contribute infrastructural investment. Saiful Islam Majumder, Senior Assistant Secretary of the Health Services Division under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, drew on his field experience, stressing the need for integrated action at district and Upazila levels by all relevant ministries. Dr Shams El Arifeen, Emeritus Scientist at icddr,b, highlighted the significant disparity between rich and poor care, describing systemic barriers as a key factor. He added that although many argue healthcare delivery is difficult in remote regions, the very recognition of this difficulty indicates the path to a solution, requiring collaboration with the relevant ministries and organisations.

    "title": "Venice Film Festival opens with star power, and Gaza protesters",
    "content": "The Venice Film Festival kicked off Wednesday with Hollywood royalty arriving for Italy's glitzy movie showcase where a strong line up of star-packed films will vie with protests about the Gaza war for public attention. Julia Roberts and George Clooney are some of the biggest names at the 82nd edition of the world's longest-running festival, with top directors from Kathryn Bigelow to Jim Jarmusch all due on the sandy Lido across the Venice lagoon. The main event in Wednesday evening's opening ceremony was Francis Ford Coppola awarding a Lifetime Achievement award to German director Werner Herzog ('Grizzly Man', 'Fitzcarraldo') for his canon of more than 70 films. Herzog, who said he always searched for the \"sublime\" in his films, will showcase his latest documentary, 'Ghost Elephants', about a lost herd in Angola, on Thursday. Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's 'La Grazia' -- about an Italian president grappling with doubts over whether to sign a euthanasia bill into law -- was the first main in-competition movie presented on Wednesday. \"Dwelling on doubt and then allowing that doubt to mature into a decision is something that is increasingly rare,\" Sorrentino told journalists. 'Mother', a film depicting Mother Teresa as a sometimes ruthless figure struggling to reconcile her views on motherhood and abortion, opened the secondary Orizzonti section. Eyes were set to quickly turn to Hollywood's favourite leading man, Clooney, who stepped off a water taxi in Venice with his wife Amal on Tuesday. On Thursday, he will be seen in the premiere of Netflix-produced comedy 'Jay Kelly', directed by Noah Baumbach, in which he plays a top Hollywood actor with an identity crisis. On the same night is the premiere of sci-fi comedy 'Bugonia' from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, which stars Emma Stone as a pharmaceutical executive kidnapped by people who mistake her for an alien. Roberts, meanwhile, will appear at Venice for the first time on Friday in the out-of-competition cancel-culture drama \"After the Hunt\", from Italy's Luca Guadagnino. Winners of the festival's prestigious Golden Bear top prize often go on to Oscar glory, such as 'Nomadland' or 'Joker' in previous years. Though the festival and this year's jury president Alexander Payne ('Sideways') were keen to focus on the roster of movies making their world premieres in the next 11 days, world events dominated their day-one press conference. Protesters held up a 'Free Palestine' banner in front of the festival's main building, while a group of Italian film professionals have called on organisers to openly condemn Israel's invasion and siege of Gaza. A demonstration to condemn Israel and the war in Gaza has been called for Saturday in Venice by hundreds of local political and rights groups. The festival had already declared \"huge sadness and suffering vis-a-vis what is happening in Gaza and Palestine\", its director Alberto Barbera told reporters. But he ruled out rescinding invitations to pro-Israeli actors. Israel's nearly two-year bombardment of Gaza also featured prominently during the Cannes film festival in May where hundreds of movie figures signed a petition saying they were \"ashamed\" of their industry's \"passivity\" about the war. The festival has selected a film about the war for its main competition -- 'The Voice of Hind Rajab' by Franco-Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, which reconstructs the death of six-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab who was killed last year by Israeli forces. The flurry of premieres to be screened in Venice also include Guillermo del Toro big-budget remake of 'Frankenstein', starring Oscar Isaac, or Bigelow's political thriller 'A House of Dynamite', starring Idris Elba. In one of the boldest casting choices, British actor Jude Law will try his hand at Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas's 'The Wizard of the Kremlin', while Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson portrays mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in much-hyped 'The Smashing Machine' from Benny Safdie. Jarmusch marks his first time in Venice's main lineup with 'Father Mother Sister Brother', bringing together Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver and Tom Waits, while Taiwan-born model and actress Shu Qi makes her directorial debut with 'Nuhai (Girl)'.",

Three transboundary rivers in the east of the country have swollen to exceptionally high levels as a result of heavy rains across the border in India. It has triggered flood alerts throughout Punjab province, home to nearly half of Pakistan's 255 million people. The army was also deployed to help evacuate people and livestock near the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers. Around 210,000 people had moved to another location, according to the disaster authorities. At the Qadirabad dam on the Chenab River, authorities carried out a controlled explosion of an embankment on Wednesday as the water levels rose. \"To save the structure, we have breached the right marginal embankment so that the flow of the water reduces,\" said Mazhar Hussain, a spokesperson for Punjab's disaster management agency. The Kartarpur temple, which marks where the founder of the Sikh faith Guru Nanak is said to have died in 1539, was submerged by floodwater. Five boats were sent to the sprawling site to rescue around 100 stranded people. Pakistan authorities said neighbouring India had released water from upstream dams on its side of the border, further increasing the flow headed towards Pakistan. Islamabad's foreign ministry said New Delhi gave advanced notice through diplomatic channels ahead of opening the spillways. Indian government officials have not commented. The flood surge \"is expected to pass through Lahore tonight and tomorrow morning\", provincial disaster chief Irfan Ali said of the Punjab capital. Pakistan has been battered by a brutal monsoon season this year, with landslides and floods triggered by torrential rain killing more than 800 people since June.",

    "title": "Emotional Intelligence: A missing component in Bangladesh's development framework",
    "content": "Bangladesh has made significant strides in various developmental indicators over the last two decades—economic growth, digital inclusion, and access to education being among the most notable. Yet, amid the emphasis on cognitive progress and infrastructural development, there remains a largely unaddressed but crucial gap in our national discourse: emotional intelligence, especially among our adolescents. This writing is based on a study titled “Emotional Intelligence: A Regional Study Based on Rural and Urban Adolescents of Bangladesh”, with a focus on understanding how emotional intelligence varies across socio-economic classes, gender, academic performance, and family structure. The findings indicate that emotional development is being overlooked—both at the family level and in institutional systems—which may have long-term implications for Bangladesh’s broader developmental goals. This study has been conducted using both primary and secondary sources of information. The process involved several distinct stages: preparation of the questionnaire and sampling framework, recruitment and training of field investigators, field-level data collection, compilation and analysis of the data, and final report writing. A Multistage Stratified Random Sampling Technique was adopted to ensure balanced representation. The sample consisted of 120 adolescents, equally divided between male and female, drawn from 12 schools across three regions: Dhaka North City Corporation, Dhaka South City Corporation, and Jamalpur district. Five schools each were selected from DNCC and DSCC, while two schools were covered from Jamalpur. Ten students were randomly chosen from each school. The respondents were grouped into five income categories, ranging from households earning below BDT 10,000 per month to those earning above BDT 60,000, to capture variations in socio-economic background. Data were collected through one-to-one interactions to maintain confidentiality. The questionnaire consisted of 37 questions, segmented into three parts: academic activities and performance, socio-economic profile (including parental occupation, education, and marital status), and emotional intelligence assessment. The emotional intelligence segment was based on the TEIQue–SF (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire–Short Form) framework, using a six-point Likert scale ranging from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” Scores were computed from the mean of ten EI-related responses, producing a scale of 1 to 6, where a score below 4 indicates emotional intelligence below the level required for healthy functioning in personal, social, and professional life. Two trained field investigators covered the DNCC and Jamalpur areas, while the DSCC sample was collected by the researcher. The training emphasized not only data collection techniques but also sensitivity in approaching adolescent respondents. The compiled data was analyzed to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and factors such as academic performance, socio-economic status, and family circumstances. Emotional Intelligence (EI), simply defined, is the ability to perceive, regulate, and express emotions appropriately and effectively, both within oneself and in interaction with others. It includes self-awareness, emotional regulation, empathy, motivation, and social adaptability.Unlike cognitive intelligence (IQ), which remains a focal point in our educational and societal structures, EI is not systematically nurtured—yet it is foundational to interpersonal functioning, mental health, decision-making, and leadership. An emotionally intelligent person is not only better equipped to cope with stress and build healthy relationships, but is also more capable of engaging meaningfully with society. As mentioned above, the research was based on data collected from 120 adolescents from three regions: Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), and Jamalpur District. Using a structured questionnaire and a 6-point Likert scale, emotional intelligence was assessed across ten behavioral indicators. The results revealed the following patterns: 1. Low national averageThe overall average emotional intelligence score among respondents was 3.48 out of 6—well below the global emotional health benchmark (4.8–5.2). This reflects a general deficiency in emotional development during the critical adolescent years. 2. Income and EI: A complex relationship Contrary to popular assumptions, higher income did not guarantee higher emotional intelligence. While moderate-income female students scored the highest (4.10), low-income males scored the lowest (2.67). Interestingly, students from high-income families often showed lower emotional intelligence when parental presence was lacking due to work or separation. 3. Gender-based trends Male students outperformed in areas like stress management, interpersonal efficiency, and deadline adherence, while female students excelled in empa",

    "title": "Nvidia beats quarterly earnings expectations",
    "content": "AI powerhouse Nvidia reported quarterly earnings Wednesday that beat expectations, but shares slipped amid concerns about an AI chip spending bubble and the company's stalled business in China. The California-based firm posted profit of $26.4 billion on record revenue of $46.7 billion in the recently ended quarter, driven by intense demand for chips from major tech companies powering AI datacenter computing. While overall revenue significantly increased year-over-year, money taken in from Nvidia's Data Center compute products like its coveted graphics processing units (GPUs) declined 1 percent from the previous quarter. The drop was driven by a $4 billion decrease in sales of H20 chips-specialized processors the company designed for the Chinese market, according to the earnings report. For the current quarter, Nvidia projected $54 billion in revenue but said its forecast assumes no H20 sales. Nvidia's high-end GPUs remain in hot demand from tech giants building data centers for artificial intelligence applications. However, investors are questioning whether the massive AI investments are sustainable. \"The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"At the same time, US export restrictions are fueling domestic chipmaking in China.\" Nvidia shares fell slightly more than 3 percent in after-market trading. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump confirmed that Nvidia would pay the United States 15 percent of its revenues from sales of certain AI chips to China. Trump called Nvidia's H20 chips \"obsolete,\" despite their previous targeting under export restrictions. Beijing has responded by expressing national security concerns about Nvidia chips and urging Chinese businesses to rely on local semiconductor suppliers instead. Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for export to China to address US concerns that its top-tier chips could be used for weapons development or AI applications in the rival nation. \"There is interest in our H20s; we have supply ready to ship,\" Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said of the China market, which he estimated to be a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. \"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do.\" Huang said Nvidia is talking with the Trump administration about the importance of US companies being able to compete in China. \"We just have to keep advocating the sensibility of, and the importance of, American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard,\" Huang said. The earnings report comes amid market worries about an AI spending bubble that could burst and hurt the chip giant's fortunes. Nvidia serves as a bellwether for the AI market and became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market value last July. \"We're just seeing just enormous amount of interest in AI and demand for AI right now,\" Huang said on an earnings call. The top four cloud computing service providers are on pace to spend about $600 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and it's reasonable to think Nvidia is in line for a lot of that money, Huang reasoned.",

    "title": "SC to hear appeal against verdict over ‘warrant of precedence’",
    "content": "The Supreme Court will hear the appeal against the verdict over the ‘warrant of precedence’ of holders of important constitutional offices of the state. The Appellate Division has set 4 November to hear the appeal. The Appellate Division has granted leave to appeal (permission to appeal) after hearing an appeal seeking a review of a verdict it delivered a decade ago, which concerned placing constitutional office holders of the state higher up in the order of precedence and priority. A six-member Appellate Division bench headed by senior justice Md Ashfaqul Islam passed the order on Thursday. The court said, “The leave has been granted. The appeal hearing will be held on 4 November. It will be on top of the cause list that day.” After the hearing on the appeal seeking a review of the Appellate Division's verdict concluded on 30 July, the Appellate Division scheduled a date for the order. Following this, the matter was listed at top of the Appellate Division's cause list for the order today. Earlier, the Appellate Division delivered a verdict on 11 January 2015 after amending the warrant of precedence. The full verdict was later published on 10 November 2016. The ruling stipulated that the constitutional office-holders of the state should be placed higher in the order of precedence and given priority; additionally, it elevated the rank of district judges by eight steps, equating them with secretaries. The Appellate Division’s observation in the verdict noted that the chief justice’s rank should be elevated by one step, equating it with that of the speaker of the national parliament, and that other distinguished figures of the state—recipients of the Swadhinata Padak, Ekushey Padak, and freedom fighters who were awarded the Bir Uttam for their role in the liberation war—should be appropriately included in the order of precedence. The cabinet secretary and the then chairman of the Public Service Commission (PSC) filed separate appeals in 2017 seeking a review of that verdict. In the review petitions, 90 deputy attorney generals and assistant attorney generals of the state intervened in support. The hearings on the review petitions began on 27 April and concluded on 30 July. In the hearing, senior advocate Salah Uddin Dolon represented the cabinet secretary, who filed the review petition. On behalf of the writ petitioners, senior advocates Prabir Niyogi and Nihad Kabir participated, while senior advocate Ahsanul Karim represented the deputy attorney generals and assistant attorney generals. According to the Rules of Business of the Cabinet Division, the Warrant of Precedence was formulated in 1986. After the President’s approval, it was issued on 11 September of the same year and has since been amended several times. The most recent amendment was made in December 2003. In creating this revised Warrant of Precedence, constitutional positions and posts recognised and defined by the Constitution were placed below the administrative cadre officers. Citing this, Md Ataur Rahman, then secretary general of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association, filed a writ petition in 2006 challenging its validity. After the final hearing of the writ petition, the High Court declared the 1986 Warrant of Precedence (as amended) illegal and void, issuing eight directives on 4 February 2010. The state appealed the High Court verdict in 2011. Following the hearing of this appeal, the Appellate Division delivered its verdict on 11 January 2015. In the context of the 2017 review petition, leave has now been granted. The hearing on the appeal is scheduled for 4 November.",

    "title": "Crimes against humanity: Formal trial begins in Abu Sayed murder case",
    "content": "The formal trial has commenced in the crimes against humanity case concerning the killing of Abu Sayed, the first martyr of the July Uprising and a student of Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur. The proceedings began at International Crimes Tribunal-2 with the presentation of the opening statement on Wednesday. The three-member tribunal, headed by Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury, heard the opening statement delivered by Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam. In his address, Tajul described Abu Sayed as the “phoenix” of the July Movement and the “vanguard” of the July martyrs. The other two tribunal members are Justice Md Manjurul Basid and Justice Nur Mohammad Shahriar Kabir. Testimony is scheduled to commence Thursday. Former Vice-Chancellor of Begum Rokeya University, Md Hasibur Rashid, along with 30 others, has been indicted in the case. Of them, 24 accused, including the former Vice-Chancellor, remain absconding. The remaining six—former Proctor Shariful Islam, former Assistant Registrar Rafiul Hasan, former contractual employee at the Registrar’s Office Anwar Parvez, former Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police Amir Hossain, former Constable Sujan Chandra Roy, and banned Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Imran Chowdhury alias Akash—were produced before the tribunal yesterday. On 16 July last year, Abu Sayed was shot dead during the anti-discrimination students’ protests in Rangpur. The video footage of his killing shocked the entire nation. It showed him standing on the road with arms outstretched, as police repeatedly fired into his chest. The incident became a turning point for the movement, unleashing outrage across the country. The tribunal’s investigation agency submitted its report against the 30 accused on 24 June this year. On 6 August, formal charges were framed. Aside from the Abu Sayed case, two further trials on crimes against humanity during the uprising are underway. In one of the cases, concerning deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, and former Inspector General of Police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, 29 witnesses have so far testified. In another case, relating to atrocities in the capital’s Chankharpul area, testimony continues against former Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Habibur Rahman, with eight witnesses examined to date. In his opening statement, Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam recounted that on 16 July, as the protest march advanced from Lalbagh towards Begum Rokeya University, heavily armed police forces obstructed the students. Under the command of then Assistant Commissioner of Rangpur Metropolitan Police, Md Arifuzzaman, five policemen struck Abu Sayed on the head with steel and wooden batons, causing him to bleed. He said former ASI Amir Hossain fired the first shot, hitting Abu Sayed in the abdomen. Though stunned, Sayed once again spread his arms and stood firm. At that point, former Constable Sujan Chandra Roy shot him twice more in the chest, causing him to collapse across the road divider. As fellow students tried to carry him away, protester Tawhidur Haque sustained about 60 shotgun pellets. Abu Sayed died en route to hospital, in the arms of his comrades. Among the 24 absconding accused are former VC Hasibur Rashid, former Associate Professors Moshiur Rahman and Asaduzzaman Mondol, physician Sarwar Hossain (Chandon), former RPMP Commissioner Md Moniruzzaman, former Deputy Commissioner Abu Maruf Hossain, former Additional Deputy Commissioner Shah Nur Alam Patowary, former AC Md Arifuzzaman, University Chhatra League President Pomel Barua, and General Secretary Md Mahafuzur Rahman. Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam argued that the trial could not be stalled by their deliberate absence or asylum abroad. “Even in absentia, justice is not compromised. Under the law, this tribunal retains full authority to deliver verdicts against the absconding accused.” The Chief Prosecutor further claimed that then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had already issued direct orders to fire upon students and protesters, as revealed in her telephone conversation with former Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor ASM Maksud Kamal. He read the transcript aloud to the tribunal. In the call, Sheikh Hasina said, “What kind of country do we live in? Did you not see what happened to the collaborators? We hanged every last one of them, and I will not spare these either.” Maksud Kamal replied: “Yes, once this unrest is over, I myself will expel from the university those at the core of this instability.” Hasina continued: “All of them must be ousted… I am telling you, after today’s tolerance, arrests will follow, and necessary action will be taken. In England, when students take to the streets for politics, did they not kill several of them outright?” Maksud Kamal said, “Yes, yes, yes.” Then Sheikh Hasina said, “There is no alternative to action. We have been far too tolerant… it has come this far.” Recalling the rise of autocrats across history, Tajul Islam said, “Sheikh Hasin",

    "content": "Former member of parliament Abdul Latif Siddiqui and Dhaka University Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman (Karzon) were besieged by a group of people who identified themselves as “July Fighters” on Thursday. The incident took place at the Dhaka Reporters’ Unity (DRU), where the two had gone to attend a roundtable this morning. The roundtable on liberation war and the constitution was organised by a platform, Mancha 71. Eminent jurist Kamal Hossain, one of the principal architects of Bangladesh’s Constitution and Emeritus President of Gono Forum, was scheduled to attend the discussion as chief guest. Although the discussion was due to start at 10:00 am, it began an hour later, at 11:00 am. Sheikh Hafizur Rahman (Karzon), Professor of Law Department at Dhaka University, was first to address the roundtable. “We are witnessing that an ill attempt is going on to throw away the country’s constitution. Jamaat (Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami), Shibir (Islami Chhatra Shibir) and National Citizen Party (NCP) are behind this. They have been adorning freedom fighters with garlands of shoes under the leadership of Professor Yunus,” he told the discussion. Immediately after the speech of Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, a group of people entered the DRU auditorium with a procession. They were chanting different slogans like “July-er hatiar, gorje uthuk arekbar”, “League dhor, jele bhor”, July-er joddhara, ek hou larai koro” and so on. At one stage, they tore down the banner of the roundtable discussion and confined the participants inside. Around 12:15 pm, a team of police from Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) arrived, and the protesters handed over at least 15 people, including former lawmaker Abdul Latif Siddique and Professor Sheikh Hafizur Rahman, to the police. Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Asaduzzaman was present at the scene. As of the time of writing this report, police remained deployed in front of the DRU. Former MP Abdul Latif Siddiqui said, “I had no idea there would be any problem here. I have no connection with the Awami League. I came only because I was invited to this event.” When asked why the roundtable participants were confined and handed over to police, a man named Al Amin Rasel said, “We are the July Fighters. Fallen Awami League, Jubo League, and banned Chhatra League leaders and activists had gathered here to conspire. As long as the July Fighters live, we will never allow such things to happen.” Shamim Hossain, a Jamaat-e-Islami leader from Paltan Thana, said, “A certain group is trying to pit 1971 against 2024 in order to discredit the latter. We believe 1971 is our foundation, and 2024 is our liberation. Those who gathered here are all involved in the killings of 2024. Many of them are facing cases. Without taking the law into our own hands, we handed them over to the police.” Among those present at the discussion were former secretary Abu Alam Shahid Khan and Professor Abdullah Al Mahmud, convener of Muktijuddho Mancha 71, among others.",

Of the three, two 12-storey hostels will be built for female students, while a 15-storey hostel will be constructed for male students. There was no formal programme on the occasion. The adviser, along with other guests, unveiled a plaque and offered prayers, said a health ministry press release. Later, she visited different departments of the hospital, including the emergency unit. The hostels are being constructed under a project approved in July 2023 for building 19 modern hostel facilities for students of 10 medical colleges at a cost of Tk 1,429 crore, to be implemented between July 2023 and June 2027. Speaking to journalists, the adviser said students had long been living in old, dilapidated hostels, constantly worried about their safety. \"How can one study under such risks? Their demand for new hostels has been longstanding. This is not just a demand; it is their right,\" she said. Sarwar Bari, secretary of the Medical Education and Family Welfare Division, said he was also a student of the college. \"The accommodation crisis here is very acute. With today's inauguration, the housing problem of the college will finally be resolved,\" he added. Prof Nazmul Hossain, director general of the Directorate General of Medical Education, said the government has begun constructing 19 hostels in 10 public medical colleges, including eight older institutions and two newly established ones. According to the Health Engineering Department, construction of the 15-storey hostel for male students will cost Tk 101.77 crore. It will have 312 residential rooms, providing 936 seats. The two 12-storey hostels for female students will cost Tk 46.53 crore and will include 144 residential rooms with 504 seats, along with other modern facilities. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

Speaking about the proportional representation (PR) system, he said, \"The best method to value every citizen's vote is the PR system. We want every vote to count, even if it is just one percent. But in reality, even if someone secures 25 percent of the votes, while others receive 24 or 23 percent, they cannot play any role in the government. As a result, nearly 75 percent of the votes are wasted.\" \"Our Ameer has demanded that the election be held in February. We will only participate if a level playing field is ensured.

    "title": "Girls’ body found in canal, investigation reveals ‘parents, brother-in-law’ killed her",
    "content": "Police have arrested the parents and brother-in-law of a teenage girl in Bauphal upazila of Patuakhali, on charges of strangling her to death over a romantic relationship. Senior assistant superintendent of police (Bauphal Circle), Arif Muhammad Shakur, shared the information during a press conference at Bauphal police station around 8:15 pm on Wednesday. The body of 14-year-old Urmi Islam was recovered from a canal, about a kilometre away from her home in Kumbhakhali village of the upazila on the morning of 23 August. Later, her father, Nazrul Islam, filed a case with the police over the murder accusing unidentified persons. Arif Muhammad Shakur said that the investigation uncovered the real motive behind the killing. Then, police arrested the victim’s father Nazrul Islam, mother Amena Begum, and brother-in-law Kamal Hossain late on Tuesday night. While in police custody, they confessed to killing the teenage girl. All three were produced before the court on Wednesday. There they gave confessional statements under Section 164, he added. According to police, Urmi was in a relationship with a local young man. She had an argument with her family members over the matter around 1:30 am on 21 August. At one point, the enraged family members strangled her causing her to suffocate and die. Afterwards, her parents and brother-in-law dumped the body in the canal. When multiple police units began investigating the case, the real facts came to light.",

    "title": "Bangladesh to import higher volumes of grains in 2025-26 marketing year: USDA",
    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Bangladesh is expected to import larger volumes of rice and wheat in the marketing year (MY) 2025-26 owing to rising domestic rice prices, according to a report by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Private importers are also likely to bring in increased quantities of maize to meet the growing demand from the poultry, cattle, and aquaculture feed sectors, the agency said in its Grain and Feed Update on Bangladesh released on August 27. The USDA forecasts that rice imports by both the public and private sectors may rise 8 percent year-on-year to 12 lakh tonnes in MY26, which begins in May. \"Domestic rice prices have reached an all-time high,\" the USDA noted, adding that the government is stepping up imports to ease market prices. In mid-July, the government announced plans to purchase 400,000 tonnes of rice through international tenders for public granaries. On August 10, the food ministry authorised 242 firms to import 500,000 tonnes in order to increase supply and curb price hikes of the staple grain. The USDA report, citing its sources, said Bangladesh imported around 200,000 tonnes of rice in the first three months of MY26 since May. Prices of all rice varieties in Bangladesh have continued to climb, reaching the highest levels ever recorded in July 2025. The average retail price of coarse rice in July 2025 stood at Tk 57.5 per kilogramme, up 12.3 percent from the same period the previous year, the report said, citing market data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). That same month, the average retail price of high-quality non-aromatic (fine) rice was 12.7 percent higher year-on-year at Tk 80 per kilogramme. \"The price increase is primarily due to higher paddy production and milling costs, overall inflation, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. Like many other agricultural commodities, the rice supply chain involves multiple market actors, ultimately driving up costs for consumers,\" the report said. The USDA projected a 2 percent year-on-year increase in rice production to 3.75 lakh tonnes in MY26, supported by favourable weather. It estimated that farmers harvested 2.05 crore tonnes of rice during the Boro season, the country's principal crop. Yields and overall Boro production were robust as there were no droughts, heatwaves, cyclones, significant pest damage, or other natural disasters, the USDA observed. The agency also forecast an expansion of acreage under the current Aman season, the rain-fed crop, with higher yields in MY26. For wheat, the USDA projected that imports by both public and private sectors may rise to 67 lakh tonnes in MY26, which starts in July, up 7.5 percent year-on-year from its MY25 estimate. Lower international prices and stable supply are likely to underpin higher wheat imports, the second staple after rice. \"In Bangladesh, wheat is used to some extent as an alternative to rice. Therefore, demand for wheat flour is likely to continue rising while rice prices remain high,\" the USDA noted. Regarding maize, the agency forecast imports to increase 6 percent year-on-year to 15 lakh tonnes in MY26, driven by feed mill demand. It also said there are strong opportunities for US maize sales to Bangladesh during this and the following marketing year. \"Bangladesh usually imports corn from Brazil, Argentina, and India due to price and logistical advantages,\" the report said, adding that buyers had shown strong interest in sourcing US maize this year owing to competitive pricing. The report added that key importers found US maize prices attractive but wanted direct engagement with US exporters. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "title": "Railway East Zone proposes fare hike through additional charges",
    "content": "Bangladesh Railways’ East Zone is planning to introduce a new fare hike for train travel. A proposal in this regard has recently been sent to the Railway Board in Dhaka. If implemented, passengers on at least eight routes under the Railway East Zone will have to pay more. This time, the railway is not directly raising ticket prices. Instead, fares will increase through the imposition of a “pontage charge”. At present, the fare for a Snigdha-class seat, including VAT, on the non-stop Subarna and Sonar Bangla Express trains on the Dhaka–Chattogram route is Tk 855. With the new charge, the fare will rise to Tk 945, meaning passengers will have to pay Tk 90 more. Depending on the type of train and seat class, the hike will range between Tk 15 and Tk 220. The last time railway fares were increased was in the 2016–17 fiscal. According to railway terminology, the pontage charge is an additional fee levied when a railway line includes a bridge or similar structure. In such cases, a bridge 100 meters in length will be considered equivalent to 2.5 kilometres of distance. This artificially increases the route length on paper, and fares rise accordingly. Sources said that East Zone Railway has proposed introducing the pontage charge on routes with bridges 100 meters or longer. Data from the engineering department shows there are 28 such bridges across eight routes in the east zone. From July to December last year, the railway earned Tk 8.36 billion from passenger and freight services and other sectors, while spending Tk 21.48 billion. In recent years, it has consistently posted average annual losses of over Tk 20 billion. Back in 2005, the railway spent Tk 1.46 for every Tk 1 it earned. On 25 May, a meeting was held at the office of the Director General of Railways to address losses and discuss ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Railway Secretary Fahimul Islam, who was present as chief guest, advised increasing earnings without raising the base fare. He instructed officials to introduce pontage charges for bridges longer than 100 meters in the East Zone. The Chief Commercial Office of Railway east Zone has confirmed that a proposal based on pontage charges has already been sent to the Railway Board. Eastern Railway covers the divisions of Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, and Mymensingh. Eastern Railway’s Chief Commercial Manager Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman told Prothom Alo, a proposal for a fare hike based on pontage charges has been sent to the Railway Board. However, the process of approval and implementation will take some time. The Chief Commercial Office has already prepared a list of proposed fares including the new charge. The process of collecting those fares will begin once administrative approval is given. Separate fare proposals have been prepared for regular trains and intercity non-stop trains. Currently, the distance on the Dhaka–Chattogram route is 346 kilometres. With the pontage charge, it will rise to 381 kilometres. As a result, mail train fares will increase from Tk 135 to Tk 150. Commuter fares will rise by Tk 20 and Shovon chair fares by Tk 40. Intercity Snigdha-class fares will go up from Tk 777 to Tk 850, an increase of Tk 73. AC berth fares, currently Tk 1,448, will rise by Tk 140. On non-stop trains such as Subarna and Sonar Bangla Express, Snigdha-class fares will rise from Tk 855 to Tk 945, an increase of Tk 90. First berth and AC seat fares will increase by Tk 100 to Tk 110, while AC berth fares will rise by around Tk 160 from the current Tk 1,587. On the Dhaka–Cox’s Bazar and Parjotok Express routes, Snigdha-class fares will increase from Tk 1,322 to Tk 1,450, an increase of Tk 128. First berth and AC seat fares will rise by Tk 150 each. AC berth fares, currently Tk 2,430, will increase to Tk 2,656, a hike of Tk 226. Criticising the move, SM Nazer Hossain, Vice President of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), said, there is no transparency or accountability in the railway’s project expenditures or operating costs. On the contrary, there are widespread irregularities. Revenue collection processes also lack transparency. Instead of increasing fares through such tactics, the railway should focus on stopping irregularities and reducing unnecessary expenses, he added.",

Highlighting 24 priority tasks, including finalisation of constituency boundaries, voter lists, political party registration and accreditation of domestic observers, the Election Commission today announced the roadmap for the next parliamentary election. In an instant reaction, BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed told The Daily Star that the announcement of the roadmap has fulfilled people's expectations. \"Everything has been done according to public expectations. I hope, now there will be no more irrelevant questions about the election,\" he said. CPB General Secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince said the announced election roadmap can only be made credible through specific and practical steps. \"Simply declaring a plan is not enough; it must be implemented effectively to gain people's trust,\" he told The Daily Star this evening. \"We want to take the Election Commission's announcement positively. But the main task now is to make it credible to the people.\" Islami Andolon Bangladesh Spokesperson Gazi Ataur Rahman told The Daily Star that last July, students and people sacrificed their blood and lives, seeking permanent freedom from autocracy in the country. \"Without giving any roadmap on that, announcing an electoral roadmap of the old arrangement is nothing but a denial of the July mass uprising,\" he said. \"Not even the slightest of fundamental reforms has been implemented. Therefore, before any other roadmap, a roadmap for implementing the July Charter must be given.\" Gazi Ataur Rahman said there has been no solution yet as to whether the election will be held under the existing system or under the PR system. \"Before a settlement of this, the Election Commission has no moral right to announce such an action plan,\" he added. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

The hunger strike began around 7:00pm on Tuesday in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture with eight participants. By today, around 20 more aspirants joined the strike. The protesters are striking for three demands -- immediate publication of the BCS (Non-Cadre) Recruitment (Special) (Amendment) Rules, 2025, in the form of a gazette; withdrawal of requisitioned posts, such as the post of headteacher in primary schools, from the non-cadre quota and an end to issuing separate circulars for these posts; and continuation of the previous practice of increasing posts in both cadre and non-cadre categories so that more candidates can be recommended for recruitment. The protesters said they resorted to a hunger strike after repeatedly holding meetings, sit-ins and submitting memorandums, but failing to get their demands met. Mahmudul Hasan, one of the protesters, told The Daily Star, \"Our current non-cadre recruitment rules are pending at the Chief Adviser's Office. Because they have not been approved, recruitment is not taking place at the PSC level even though posts are available. Some quarters are trying to obstruct the process. By arranging separate recruitment, they want to continue their so-called recruitment syndicate.\" Jannatul Bakia, another protester, said: \"Our demands are not very difficult to meet. All necessary procedures have already been completed and submitted to CA's office. But there has been no progress since then. We spoke with the PSC chairman, and he assured us of his sincerity. Yet without the gazette being published, they cannot proceed.\" Moinuddin, another job seeker, alleged, \"Our demand is stuck at the CA's office because of recruitment trade. Some influential quarters are unwilling to accept it. That is why we will continue our hunger strike here until the gazette is approved.\" সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "title": "US corporate profits rebound in second quarter; GDP growth revised higher",
    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions US corporate profits rebounded in the second quarter, but tariffs on imports are raising costs for businesses, which could limit further gains and hamper economic growth. Profits from current production with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $65.5 billion last quarter, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) said on Thursday. Profits decreased $90.6 billion in the January-March period. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policy has raised the nation's average import duty to its highest level in a century, inflicting pain on companies ranging from retailers to manufacturers. Caterpillar this month warned tariffs could cost the economic bellwether up to $1.5 billion this year. In July, General Motors' second-quarter earnings took a $1.1 billion hit from the duties and the automaker anticipated more pain in the third quarter. Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch on Wednesday warned that higher tariffs on countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia and India would increase costs by $90 million this year. The manner in which the Trump administration has implemented the tariffs, including escalations and 90-day pauses, has muddied the waters, making it challenging for economists to parse economic data. A front-loading of imports as businesses rushed to beat the duties pulled down gross domestic product in the first quarter before snapping back as the flow of foreign merchandise ebbed. GDP increased at a 3.3% annualised rate last quarter, the BEA said in its second estimate. The economy was initially reported to have grown at a 3.0% pace in the second quarter. It contracted at a 0.5% pace in the January-March quarter, which was the first GDP decline in three years. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth would be raised to a 3.1% rate. The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending, the economy's main engine, as well as business investment in equipment. Both first- and second-quarter GDP readings are not a true reflection of the economy's health because of the wild swings in imports. To get a better read of the economy, economists have recommended focusing on the final sales to private domestic purchasers measure, which excludes trade, inventories and government spending. This measure, also viewed by policymakers as a barometer of underlying economic growth, increased at an upwardly revised 1.9% pace last quarter. Domestic demand was initially estimated to have grown at a 1.2% rate. It advanced at a 1.9% pace in the first quarter. EASING LABOR MARKET Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week signaled a possible interest rate cut at the US central bank's September 16-17 policy meeting, in a nod to rising labor market risks, but also added that inflation remained a threat. The Fed has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range since December. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 4.8% pace in the second quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a 0.2% pace in the January-March period. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, rebounded at a 4.0% pace. Gross domestic output fell at a 0.1% rate in the first quarter. Economists expect a lackluster second half, which would limit growth to about 1.5% for the full year because of tariffs. That reading would be down from 2.8% in 2024 and below the 1.8% rate Fed officials view as the non-inflationary growth pace. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions UN rights experts voiced alarm Thursday at reports of \"enforced disappearances\" of starving Palestinians seeking food at distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), urging Israel to end the \"heinous crime\". The seven independent experts said in a joint statement they had received reports that a number of individuals, including one child, had been \"forcibly disappeared\" after going to aid distribution sites in Rafah, southern Gaza. \"Reports of enforced disappearances targeting starving civilians seeking their basic right to food is not only shocking, but amounts to torture,\" said the experts, who are mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations itself. \"Using food as a tool to conduct targeted and mass disappearances needs to end now.\" Israel's military was reportedly \"directly involved in the enforced disappearances of people seeking aid\", said the statement signed by the five members of the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, along with Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on rights in the Palestinian territories, and her counterpart on the right to food, Michael Fakhri. Israel's military was \"refusing to provide information on the fate and whereabouts of persons they have deprived of their liberty\", in violation of international law, the statement said. \"The failure to acknowledge deprivation of liberty by state agents and refusal to acknowledge detention constitute an enforced disappearance.\" The UN declared a famine in Gaza governorate last week, blaming \"systematic obstruction\" of humanitarian deliveries by Israel. Israel, which has accused Hamas of looting aid supplied by the UN, imposed a total blockade on Gaza between March and May. Once it began easing restrictions, the GHF, a private organisation supported by Israel and the United States, was established to distribute food aid, effectively sidelining UN agencies. The experts pointed to how \"aerial bombardment and daily gunfire at and around the crowded facilities have resulted in mass casualties\". \"The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is obligated to provide secure distribution sites and has contracted private military security companies to that end,\" they said. The UN human rights office said last week it had documented that 1,857 Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid since late May, including 1,021 near GHF sites. Now, the experts warned, \"the distribution points pose additional risks for devastated individuals of being forcibly disappeared\". The experts urged Israeli authorities to \"put an end to the heinous crime against an already vulnerable population\". They demanded that the authorities \"clarify the fate and whereabouts of disappeared persons and investigate the enforced disappearances thoroughly and impartially and punish perpetrators\". সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions A Dhaka court today ordered the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to freeze 120 bank accounts owned by former land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury, his family members, and their beneficiaries over corruption allegations brought against them. The former land minister and others deposited Tk 44,24,70,965.87 in these accounts. Judge (in-charge) Md Ibrahim Miah of the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court passed the order after ACC Deputy Director Md Moshiur Rahman, who is leading the investigation team, submitted an application in this regard. In the application, the ACC official said that Saifuzzaman and others might attempt to transfer the money from the accounts at any time and from anywhere. If they do so, it could hinder the investigation into the allegations brought against them. Therefore, an order was required to prevent such transfers. On July 9, the same court directed the ACC to freeze 26 Beneficiary Owner's (BO) accounts owned by Saifuzzaman, his family members, and their beneficiaries over similar corruption allegations. The former land minister and others deposited Tk 576,08,77,730 in these accounts. On June 22, the same court issued a travel ban on Saifuzzaman and his wife, Rukhmila Zaman, over corruption allegations. On June 12, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) froze properties in the United Kingdom owned by Saifuzzaman, reports Al Jazeera. The move follows legal requests from Bangladeshi authorities to take action against assets owned by Saifuzzaman, a political ally of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Saifuzzaman is under investigation by Bangladeshi authorities for money laundering. Saifuzzaman owns at least 260 properties in the United Kingdom, for which he has paid at least GBP 134.76 million or Tk 1,888 crore, according to The Daily Star's calculation from company filings publicly available on UK government websites. The three-time Awami League lawmaker also has at least 537 mortgages against properties in the UK. A vast majority of these properties are located in London. However, his tax returns, submitted along with his affidavit to the Election Commission, state that he has no foreign income. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

Akhter Hossain, director general of the Anti-Corruption Commission, today confirmed that the anti-graft body filed the case after primary investigation. The other accused include Miftah Uddin, former EVP of Islami Bank Bangladesh; Mohammad Monirul Mawla, former managing director of the bank; Akij Uddin, former deputy managing director; Md Moshiur Rahman, managing director of Shob Meher Spinning Mills Ltd; Mohammad Shawkat Usman, director of Shob Meher Spinning Mills Ltd; Md Alomash Ali, proprietor of Top Ten Trading House; Bedarul Islam, proprietor of Gold Star Trading House; and Nurul Alam, proprietor of Alam Trading and Business House. According to the ACC, the accused allegedly conspired to abuse their authority and breach trust to commit large-scale financial fraud. The accused allegedly embezzled a total of Tk 548 crore and transferred or converted it into S Alam Group-affiliated companies, committing punishable offences under Sections 409, 109, and 420 of the Penal Code 1860, Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, and Sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the Money Laundering Prevention Act 2012.

ACC Director General Akhter Hossain confirmed the filing, saying that the case was lodged under Section 19(1) of the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004, and Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. The other accused are former secretary and executive director of the Bridge Authority Khandaker Anwarul Islam, former chief engineer Kabir Ahmed, and former director and permanent member Ali Ullah Ahmed. According to the case statement, the accused abused their authority and bypassed several critical stages of the project. Recommendations from foreign experts were ignored, while the environmental impact assessment, feasibility study and an independent tunnel board were skipped. As a result, the project's cost rose abnormally, causing an estimated Tk 585.29 crore loss to the state exchequer, the ACC said. The commission has also formed a three-member investigation team led by ACC Deputy Director Mohammad Sirajul Haque, with Assistant Director Abdul Malek and Assistant Deputy Director Anisur Rahman as members. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

He said, \"This was in response to students' demands regarding overall security during the election. One of the key demands was to move polling centres out of the residential halls, which has been addressed.\" He also mentioned that it will take approximately eight minutes for each student to cast all of their votes. \"Everyone will be able to vote.

The ordinance defines an enforced disappearance as a situation where a government employee or law enforcement member -- acting alone or with authorisation or tacit approval -- arrests, detains, abducts, or otherwise deprives a person of liberty, while denying such actions and concealing the person's fate or whereabouts, placing them outside legal protection. Under the draft, individuals convicted of the offense will face life imprisonment or up to 10 years in jail, along with a fine of up to Tk 50 lakh. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendat",

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver.

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital.

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The plot was nothing special; a patch of sandy ground in front of a tired 90s building in Uttara. A garage, a storage room, a 4x4 bathroom, and some plants left to fend for themselves. Two half-dead trees — one jackfruit, one neem — stood quietly at the edge of being forgotten. But for architect S M Ehsan Uz Zaman, it wasn't just a leftover site. It was memory, erosion, resistance — and eventually, the foundation for what he calls \"The Story of a Tree.\" He convinced his client to work around the land, not over it. And that's how the Albion Art Gallery came to be — not as a sleek intervention, but as a story about not erasing what was already there. Zaman's client, Mahmood Ullah, had a clear ask; an outdoor coffee bar with seating, an exhibition space inside the old garage, and rooftop dining. Trees and ground cover were viewed as obstacles. But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed. That one decision meant giving up a few seats in the café plan. But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design. If anything, he's sceptical of how loosely the word is used. \"I don't think this project is a showcase for green architecture,\" he says. \"But maybe it starts a conversation.\" He's critical of how the industry handles ecology. \"As architects, we say we care. But we keep letting trees fall. We put a few planters on balconies and call it sustainability. We cool our buildings with air conditioning instead of shade.\" Zaman's firm, Ehsan Uz Zaman and Associates, takes on all kinds of work — residential, public, and private. But he's most drawn to commercial spaces like cafes and galleries, where design can shape behaviour and not just aesthetics. Asked if he'd host student workshops or open the space up for learning, he's unsure. \"I don't know if this project qualifies as an example,\" he says. \"But maybe it's enough to get people asking better questions.\" Albion Art Gallery isn't perfect. It isn't cutting-edge. And that's the point. It's a quiet project. One where a counter got smaller so a tree could live. One where an architect didn't try to impress anyone — he just refused to erase what was already there. Zaman didn't build for the portfolio. He built for the space. That's the story. And that's enough. Photo: Courtesy সবচেয়ে কম দূষিত জেলা লালমনিরহাটেও কণা দূষণ ডব্লিউএইচও নির্দেশিকার সাতগুণ বেশি।",
