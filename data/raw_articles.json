    "title": "Gazipur Fear descends on industrial city after dusk, 19 areas identified as high-risk",
    "content": "On the night of 16 August, Ashik Chowdhury, a sales representative of a pharmaceutical company, was travelling by autorickshaw from Barbari in Gazipur city to Tongi’s board bazar. Several passengers were already seated there in disguise. Upon reaching at Gacha, they robbed him of Tk 150,000 (1.5 lakh) and two mobile phones. Earlier, on 7 August, journalist Asaduzzaman Tuhin, 38, was hacked to death in Gazipur. He was murdered after recording a video of muggers chasing a victim. These incidents are not isolated but reflect the city’s worsening law and order situation. Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) areas have seen a rise in muggings, extortion particularly after dusk, abductions, sexual assaults and even murders. Between 13 and 15 August, visits across Gazipur city and conversations with residents from various social and professional backgrounds revealed widespread insecurity and concern. Citizens alleged that the police are failing to prevent crimes. They pointed out that police patrols, checkpoints and proactive vigilance are no longer visible as before, allowing criminals to act with growing impunity. A recent investigative report by Police Headquarters also highlighted the deterioration of Gazipur’s law and order situation, describing it as “very poor.” The report noted a marked increase in theft, mugging and robbery within GMP areas. Alarmingly, these incidents often occur during daylight hours, yet officers-in-charge (OCs) of local police stations remain passive. The report alleged that they collect substantial sums of illicit payments from drug traffickers and muggers instead of taking preventive action. However, Iskandar Habibur Rahman, Officer-in-Charge of Tongi West Police Station, rejected the allegations when contacted, terming them “baseless.” Gazipur, a city dense with industry, falls under the jurisdiction of GMP, covering an area of 330 square kilometres and home to approximately 3.5 million residents. It is a vital production hub for both the export sector and domestic markets. Yet, as evening approaches, fear grips ordinary citizens moving along the streets. At present, GMP has 1,765 police personnel across eight police stations. However, residents frequently complain of inadequate police activity. For example, on 19 January, journalist Ashraful Alam was attacked by muggers while returning home through Tongi’s Kaderia Gate area. The assailants struck him on the head with a sharp weapon before stealing his mobile phone and cash. Local residents reported several similar incidents in the same locality. Both citizens and police acknowledge that mugging is particularly prevalent in 19 locations across Gazipur area. These include Sandarpara road junction, Honda Lane, behind Shaheed Ahsan Ullah Master General Hospital, Mill Gate, National Tubes Road junction, Safiuddin Road junction, Hossain Market katpotti, Gazipura Bashpotti, Targach, Gazipur Chandona Chowrasta, Tongi Station Road, Tongi Bridge, Tongi Bazar, Joydebpur Bazar, Lakshmipura, Konabari, Bhogra Bypass and beneath the Gazipur flyover. Residents explained that at evening, gangs of teenage and young adult muggers intercept rickshaws or autorickshaws at knifepoint, demanding money and valuables. In some cases, they block darkened roads or snatch phones and jewellery through bus windows while vehicles stand idle. Resistance often results in stabbing. For instance, on 11 July, muggers fatally stabbed Mahfuzur Rahman, a college student and part-time worker, in front of the Tongi Roads and Highways office, as he was travelling from his rented house to his workplace. According to Police Headquarters statistics, between February and July this year, 34 cases of robbery and mugging were recorded in Gazipur city. In the previous six months, 26 cases were filed. However, many victims are not interested to file complaints due to fears of harassment and inconvenience. Experts believe this under-reporting prevents police statistics from reflecting the true extent of crime. In some instances, only General Diaries (GDs) are filed for loss of valuables. Mugging is most common around Chandona Chowrasta, where journalist Asaduzzaman was brutally murdered. Police confirmed that all nine individuals arrested in connection with his killing were active muggers. On 14 August, coconut vendor Saeed Mia told Prothom Alo that muggings have now increased while police visibility has declined. He recalled that only a few days earlier, a fellow vendor was robbed of six thousand taka at knifepoint by muggers in the same area. Another hotspot for muggings is the Tongi Mazar slum. Abdul Latif Sikder, a businessman at the Sena Kalyan Commercial Complex adjacent to the slum, told Prothom Alo, ‘The market remains open until 9 p.m. every night. Muggings are frequently seen on the road in front of the market at night, yet the police are nowhere to be seen.’ Ordinarily, the police are expected to maintain a record of professional muggers. However, GMP officials admitted they ",

    "title": "Meeting with Pakistan minister 1971 issue needs to be 'dealt with' to advance Bangladesh-Pakistan relations: NCP",
    "content": "NCP leaders emphasised the importance of moving beyond the historically strained relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan and building a more positive and cooperative partnership. They also stated that, in order to advance bilateral relations, Pakistan must “deal with” the issues related to 1971. On Saturday afternoon, a seven-member delegation from the NCP held a meeting with the visiting Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister at the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka. According to Akhtar Hossain, these matters were discussed during the meeting. After the meeting, NCP member secretary Akhtar Hossain told journalists that they had tried to convey to the visiting delegation the public perception in Bangladesh regarding Pakistan. He said the National Citizen Party (NCP) believes that despite the previously hostile relationship between Pakistan and Bangladesh, there is now an opportunity for improvement. However, he emphasised that the public’s perception of Pakistan must be taken into serious consideration. “We believe that in order to enhance relations with Bangladesh—or any form of bilateral engagement—Pakistan must address the issue of 1971,” Akhtar Hossain said. “We raised this matter with them during the meeting.” When asked whether Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar made any specific remarks about the three unresolved issues from 1971—which many consider to be key obstacles to improving ties—Akhtar Hossain replied that Pakistan would provide its response on the matter. In response to a similar question from journalists, NCP’s chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwari said, “We told them that the 1971 issue should be resolved without delay. They responded that they are ready to address it.” There are three longstanding unresolved issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan related to the 1971 Liberation War: A formal apology from Pakistan for the genocide, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis and Bangladesh’s rightful share of pre-1971 undivided assets. In April, the Bangladesh government raised these issues during a meeting at the foreign secretary level between the two countries. According to foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain, the same issues are expected to be on the agenda during the foreign minister's meeting scheduled for Sunday. Speaking about the topics discussed with Ishaq Dar, NCP member secretary Akhtar Hossain said, “We talked about the potential for strengthening Bangladesh–Pakistan relations in the fields of education, economy, and culture. There was a shared understanding that relations among South Asian countries—including Bangladesh—should be based on brotherhood. The discussion emphasised that there should be no 'big brother' attitude, aggression, or hegemonic mindset among these nations.” NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwari added that the possibility of establishing a Pakistani cultural centre in Bangladesh was also discussed. “We talked about how to develop exchange programmes at the university level and how to enhance cooperation in the defence sector,” he said. Patwari also noted that the discussion covered Bangladesh’s evolving foreign policy in the context of the 1971 Liberation War and the 2024 mass uprising. Additionally, issues related to river management and the pharmaceutical industry were brought up. Regarding the SAARC meeting, Patwari remarked, “SAARC has remained inactive due to India. We discussed how to revitalise it in South Asia.” He added, “Pakistan is also a nuclear power and holds significant influence in the region.”",

    "title": "Gunfire heard again along Teknaf border, Rohingyas attempt to cross",
    "content": "The situation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State is becoming increasingly tense again as armed clashes and exchanges of gunfire are taking place between the Arakan Army and other armed groups. Arakan Army currently controls parts of Rakhine. With the fresh round of fighting, Rohingyas in those areas are suffering casualties. Many are attempting to cross the Naf river by boat into Bangladesh. Multiple sources along the border said that heavy gunfire broke out in several villages across the Naf river opposite of Teknaf’s Whykong border around 10:00pm on Friday. The intermittent shooting continued until 5:00am on Saturday. Residents on the Bangladeshi side could hear the gunfire across the river. Earlier, on 19 August night, a five-hour-long gun battle took place between armed groups in the “Narkel Bagan” area of Rakhine State across the Ghumdhum border in Naikhongchhari upazila. Reportedly, other groups launched the assault in an attempt to capture two border outposts held by the Arakan Army. Ten days before that, there had been another clash in the same area. Sirajul Mostafa Chowdhury, a member of ward No. 2  of the Whykong union parishad, also heard the gunfire across the border on Friday night. He told Prothom Alo that continued fire was heard across the border from 10:00pm Friday to 5:00am Saturday. This spread panic among Bangladeshi fishermen who had gone to the Naf river to fish, as well as residents of the Whykong border areas. However, no bullets landed inside Bangladesh border. The BGB is patrolling the river. Sirajul added that residents of Whykong border heard the deafening sounds of mortar shells from across the border for 11 months at a stretch last year. There was a respite for seven to eight months. But suddenly last night, the gunfire across the river woke up Teknaf residents and left many shocked. Near the embankment along the Whykong border, Bangladeshis operate several shrimp and crab farms. At one shrimp enclosure lives Mahmudur Rahman, a local resident and shrimp businessman. Naf river lies east of his enclosure, and Rakhine state beyond it. Worried after a night of gunfire, Mahmudur Rahman told Prothom Alo that across from Whykong Union lie several villages in Rakhine State—Kumirkhali, Shilkali, and Saidong. Eight years ago, these villages still had Rohingya settlements. But after 25 August, 2017, the Myanmar junta expelled hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas and pushed them into Bangladesh. Later, the junta built army barracks and border guard outposts there. On 7 December last year, the Arakan Army ousted the junta forces and took control of those camps and barracks. Now, various armed groups are attacking Arakan Army positions. According to multiple border sources, armed groups such as the Arakan Salvation Army (ARSA), Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (ARSO), and Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA), among others, have been launching fresh attacks on Arakan Army positions for quite some time now. As a result, many Rohingyas are being displaced and trying to flee to Bangladesh. It is reported that several thousand Rohingyas are currently gathered near the Naf River by Maungdaw township. Some are being caught by the BGB as they attempt to cross the river into Teknaf. Just yesterday (Friday), Teknaf BGB intercepted 62 Rohingyas in the Naf river. Confirming this, Lieutenant Colonel Ashiqur Rahman, commander of the Teknaf-2 BGB Battalion, told Prothom Alo that reports suggest thousands of Rohingyas across the river are waiting to enter Bangladesh. To prevent infiltration, the BGB is active along both the river and the land border. “Some people are trying to cross the border, but we are not allowing anyone in. Along with increasing patrols at the crossing points, surveillance has been tightened,” the BGB commander added. Sheikh Ehsan Uddin, the Teknaf Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), told Prothom Alo that the incident of gunfire in Rakhine has been reported to higher authorities. \"Our law enforcement personnel at the border are on alert. In addition, the BGB and Coast Guard are in strong positions along land and waterways to prevent infiltration,” he added. BGB and police sources said that a member of Arakan Army named Jibon Tanchangya fled into Ukhiya in Bangladesh, surrendering to BGB with an AK-47 rifle, 52 rounds of ammunition, and two magazines, on 11 August. He is currently in BGB custody and has claimed to be a Bangladeshi citizen. On 17 August at noon, BGB arrested two more Arakan Army associates from the Tumbru border. Naikhongchhari police station’s officer in charge (OC) Md Masrul Haque said BNP has arrested five individuals so far and handed them over to police. Three among them are Myanmar citizens and two Bangladeshis. All are now in Bandarban jail, he added.",

    "title": "HSC admission: No students selected in 378 colleges and madrasahs",
    "content": "No students were selected for admission to 378 colleges and madrasahs across the country in the upcoming academic year. Additionally, 10 colleges received no applications at all. Under the Rajshahi Education Board, RMJ College has 150 seats available for admission to the 11th grade. However, not a single student was selected for admission there. Similarly, Jaflong Hanifa Khatun Memorial College in Sylhet has 300 seats, but no students were selected for admission either. The first phase results for admission to the 11th grade for the 2025–26 academic year were published on Wednesday. This information was revealed upon reviewing the published results. Meanwhile, 25,348 students were not selected for admission despite applying - among them are 5,765 students who achieved GPA-5. Admission to the 11th grade in all colleges and madrasahs across the country (except for a few institutions such as Notre Dame College) is being centrally coordinated. This centralised online admission process is conducted under the Dhaka Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, with technical support from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). No entrance exams are held under this system; students are selected based on their SSC and equivalent exam results. It is worth noting that admissions under the Technical Education Board follow a separate process. The results of the SSC and equivalent examinations were published on 10 July. This year, a total of 1,904,086 students registered under 11 education boards, of whom 1,303,426 passed. This means more than 600,000 students did not pass. According to the Dhaka Education Board, there are a total of 8,015 eligible colleges and madrasahs for admission this year, offering 2,563,063 seats for 11th-grade students. Against these seats, 1,073,310 eligible students applied. Of them, 1,047,962 students were selected for admission, while more than 25,000 students who applied were not selected. In this admission process, students must submit a fixed application fee and apply to a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 colleges or madrasahs, ranking them in order of preference. Based on a student’s academic merit, quota (if applicable), and preferences, they are placed in one of the institutions they applied to. According to the Dhaka Education Board, it has been observed that many students tend to apply mostly to well-known or familiar colleges and madrasahs. However, due to a mismatch between their results, preferences, and seat availability, not all applicants are selected for admission. There are, however, second and third phases of the admission process. Students who did not apply in the first phase will still have the opportunity to apply during these two later rounds. That said, options become more limited in the second and third phases, and the chances of getting into a preferred institution are significantly reduced. A list has been prepared of the top 10 colleges based on the number of applications received. Among them, the highest number of applications was submitted to Government Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh. This college has 981 seats, but received 36,185 applications for admission.The second highest was Adamjee Cantonment College in Dhaka, which has 2,161 seats and received 35,082 applications. The remaining eight institutions on the list are: BAF Shaheen College (Dhaka), Shaheed AHM Kamaruzzaman Government Degree College, Kabi Nazrul Government College, Rajshahi Government College, Baklia Government College, Government AH College (Bogura), Dinajpur Government College, and New Government Degree College. Number of institutions without any admitted students by education boardAccording to the Dhaka Education Board, of the 378 colleges and madrasahs where no students were selected for admission in the first phase, the breakdown by education board is as follows:Rajshahi: 56 institutionsDinajpur: 42 institutionsDhaka: 39 institutionsMymensingh: 35 institutionsJashore: 16 institutionsBarishal: 13 institutionsCumilla: 12 institutionsSylhet: 3 institutionsChattogram: 1 institutionMadrasahs (nationwide): 161 institutions A total of 10 colleges across the country did not receive a single application for admission. Of these, nine are under the Barishal Education Board. One such example is Kathalia Secondary Girls' School and College, which has 450 available seats — yet no students applied for admission there. Under the Chattogram Education Board, one college also received no applications. Regarding the 378 colleges and madrasahs that failed to enroll any students, and the 25,000+ students who applied but were not selected for admission anywhere, Prothom Alo spoke with Professor Khondoker Ehsanul Kabir, Chairman of the Dhaka Education Board and President of the Inter-Education Board Coordination Committee. He said, “In previous years, many students applied during the second phase as well. We believe the same will happen this year. However, the actual reasons will only be",

    "title": "Meeting with Pakistan minister Two govts to address unresolved issues: Jamaat leader Taher",
    "content": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdullah Muhammad Taher has said that the unresolved issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan are matters for the two governments to address. He made the remarks following a meeting with Ishaq Dar, who is currently visiting Dhaka. The discussion also touched on Bangladesh’s upcoming national election. On Saturday afternoon, Jamaat-e-Islami leaders met with Ishaq Dar at the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka. The Jamaat delegation was led by the party’s Nayeb-e-Ameer Abdullah Muhammad Taher. After the meeting, Abdullah Muhammad Taher told journalists that the discussions focused on issues of mutual interest between the two countries, regional trade, and ways to further strengthen bilateral relations. He said they also talked about how to deepen ties with a brotherly Muslim nation in the days ahead, and how to make the regional alliance SAARC more active and effective. When asked about discussions on moving forward after nearly 15 years of strained relations, the Jamaat leader said that Bangladesh’s foreign policy over the past 15 years had been somewhat one-sided. “Now both the Bangladesh government and we believe that it is important to maintain good relations with all neighboring countries in the region. Both sides emphasised that point,\" he added. Referring to a bilateral meeting scheduled with the government on Sunday, Abdullah Muhammad Taher said that the unresolved issues in bilateral relations should be addressed promptly in a favourable environment. When asked whether the unresolved issues from 1971 were raised in the meeting, he responded, “These matters are for the two governments to discuss. We hope the government will take them up.” When asked whether the upcoming national election was discussed, he said it came up only in passing and was not a major topic of discussion. Abdullah Muhammad Taher also mentioned that they discussed with Ishaq Dar the importance of unity among Muslim nations in the face of ongoing global aggression against Muslims, as well as standing for justice and humanity.",

    "title": "Analysis From Nuremberg to Dhaka: Autocracy in the mirror of confession",
    "content": "In the digital age of the 21st century, concealing crimes has become increasingly difficult for authoritarian rulers — and the case of Bangladesh stands as a glaring example. When the 'truth of careless moment' captured through technology merge with \"confessions\" born of conscience, they can become some of the most compelling evidence in history. Arif Rahman analyses aspects of the confessions related to crimes against humanity committed under the then-authoritarian regime during July–August 2024. As we know, under international criminal law, a \"confession\" is not limited to an accused person admitting guilt in court. Its scope is broader and can be categorised into several types: Direct Confession: A straightforward admission of the crime by the accused or a close associate. For example, a senior official giving testimony as a state witness. Unintentional Confession: A statement made in an attempt to justify or cover up a crime, which inadvertently confirms involvement or reveals the underlying policy behind the crime. For instance, claiming that the violence was necessary for \"state security\" or to \"suppress extremism.\" Evidentiary Confession: Leaked audio, video, or classified documents that clearly expose the planning or ordering of the crime. Even without the speaker’s intent, these become evidence against them. Legally, a strong confession helps connect the weakest links in the \"chain of command.\" It establishes a direct causal relationship between on-the-ground violence and top-level directives—something that is often difficult to prove with other forms of evidence. In Bangladesh’s case, the evidence that surfaced in July–August represents a powerful combination of all three types of confession. At the centre of the July–August events is a leaked audio recording allegedly featuring the voice of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in which directives such as the use of “lethal weapons” and orders to “shoot wherever they are found” were reportedly given. Forensic verification of the recording—particularly ENF (Electric Network Frequency) analysis—by international media outlets including the BBC and Al Jazeera has elevated it from a mere allegation to the level of an evidentiary confession. This is a statement captured in an unguarded or unintended moment, which could serve as evidence of a policy-level decision and intent to use violence, emanating from the highest level of the state. Much like the video recording of a corruption-related meeting between Peruvian dictator Fujimori and his intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, which served as irrefutable evidence in court, this audio recording is even more serious—because it directly relates to orders involving the loss of human life. One of the most dramatic and legally significant developments in the July–August 2024 cases of state-sponsored violence was the reported decision of then-Inspector General of Police (IGP), Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, to turn state witness in relation to the killings. As the highest-ranking official in the law enforcement chain of command, his testimony effectively ends any debate over the \"chain of command.\" His statement could demonstrate that: a) The police and other security forces did not fire independently or in self-defence. b) They received clear and direct orders from the highest levels of authority. c) A well-organised operational structure was in place to execute these orders. Such a confession forms a living bridge between the leaked audio directives and the footage of on-the-ground killings (such as those verified through ballistic analysis by Drik Lab). It effectively eliminates any avenue for plausible deniability—a defence strategy often used by authoritarian leaders to avoid responsibility. Unintentional confession: The official narrative and subsequent actionsDuring and after the protests, various ministers and leaders of the Awami League government attempted to justify the violence by labeling protesters as “terrorists,” “agents of Jamaat-BNP,” and “anti-state forces.” In the eyes of international law, such statements also qualify as a form of unintentional confession. They reveal that the state had designated a specific group as an enemy and had adopted the use of force against them as a matter of state policy. The report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) cites incidents such as the erasure of CCTV footage from hospitals, obstruction of medical treatment for the injured, and the failure to conduct an independent investigation afterward. Each of these actions serves as evidence of a coordinated attempt to conceal crimes—strongly pointing toward a planned, state-sponsored operation. To fully understand the combined weight of these three forms of confession, we must turn to history. The prosecution of the Nazis relied primarily on evidentiary confessions. Their bureaucratic habit of meticulously documenting everything became their own trap. Various decrees, ord",

    "title": "India’s yarn imports see little impact despite restrictions",
    "content": "Although the Bangladesh government halted yarn imports through land ports from India in mid-April this year, yarn imports from India have decreased only slightly despite the restrictions. This is because, after imports through land ports were stopped, yarn began to come in through sea ports. According to data from the National Board of Revenue (NBR), yarn imports from India decreased by 230,000 kilograms in the three months after the suspension compared to the three months before. Earlier, an average of 50 million kilograms of yarn came in per month from that country. After the restrictions, in May and June, the average import was 40 million kilograms. In July, yarn imports again exceeded 50 million kilograms. Several textile mill owners said that more yarn than declared would enter the country due to a lack of monitoring at land ports. Even 80-count yarn would be smuggled in along with consignments of 30-count yarn (the fineness or coarseness of yarn is measured in counts). Such yarn imported under bond facilities would be sold cheaply in the local market by unscrupulous importers. This pushed domestic yarn mills into huge losses. After the restrictions, false declarations for yarn imports from India stopped. As a result, demand for domestic yarn increased. To completely eliminate irregularities, they believe strict enforcement of yarn count testing at Chattogram port is necessary. It has been learned that at the end of March this year, Bangladesh’s commerce ministry decided to stop yarn imports through land ports. On 15 April, the NBR issued a notification cancelling facilities for yarn imports through the land ports of Benapole, Bhomra, Sonamasjid, Banglabandha, and Burimari. Complaints had long been raised by Bangladesh’s textile sector entrepreneurs that expensive yarn was being imported from India under false declarations and at lower prices. Following those complaints, the decision was made to suspend yarn imports through land ports. Just before Bangladesh stopped yarn imports through land ports, on 9 April, India withdrew the facility for Bangladesh to use Indian ports for transhipment to third countries. On 17 May and 27 June, India imposed restrictions in two phases on exports of garments, food products, jute goods, cotton waste, plastic products, and wooden furniture. On 11 August, India imposed further restrictions on a number of jute products. On condition of anonymity, a business leader told Prothom Alo that after Bangladesh imposed restrictions on yarn imports, the Indian government withdrew the facility of using its ports for transhipment of Bangladeshi goods to third countries. Although Bangladesh ranks second in the world in ready-made garment exports and has more than 500 spinning mills, a huge amount of yarn still has to be imported every year. Nearly half of this comes from India. The second-highest quantity comes from China. According to NBR data, 720 million kilograms of yarn were imported in the first seven months of this year (January–July). This cost 2.2 billion US dollars. Of this, 47 per cent or 340 million kilograms came from India, while 38 per cent or 276.1 million kilograms came from China. In January, February, and March this year, yarn imports from India were 55.1 million kilograms, 52.1 million, and 51.3 million kilograms respectively. When restrictions were imposed in April, imports dropped to 45.7 million kilograms. In the following two months, May and June, imports were 41.5 million and 40.5 million kilograms respectively. In July, imports rose again to 53.4 million kilograms. It has been learned that yarn from India comes mainly from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. Earlier, yarn would be stockpiled around the Benapole border. Once import orders were placed, Indian exporters would ship the goods within a couple of days, allowing garment factories in Bangladesh to receive yarn within a week. Currently, importing through sea ports takes 20–25 days. However, transporting yarn by ship is cheaper. When asked, Khorshed Alam, director of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA), said, “We do not want yarn imports from India to stop. We only wanted imports of higher-count yarn under false declarations to stop. After imports through land ports were stopped, higher-count Indian yarn is no longer available in the market. As a result, sales of local spinning mills have increased.” When asked why yarn imports from India have not decreased, he said Indian exporters receive cash incentives for yarn exports, allowing them to supply at a lower price than Bangladesh. According to BTMA, there are 519 spinning mills in Bangladesh. These mills supply 85–90 per cent of yarn for knitwear and about 40 per cent for woven fabric. However, several rounds of gas and electricity price hikes have increased production costs for yarn. Local yarn mills have also long suffered due to gas shortages. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) president Mohammad Hatem said, ",

    "title": "Attempts to spread extremism are frustrating: Mirza Fakhrul",
    "content": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has said that debates over state reform discussions have created frustration. He added that arguments are part of democracy, but at times they are reaching a point of frustration. He made the remarks on Saturday morning at a discussion titled “How Secure is Social Security?” held at the National Press Club in Dhaka. He was present as the chief guest at the event organised by Orpon Alok Sangha, an organisation of affected BNP leaders and activists. Mirza Fakhrul, however, said that he is an optimist and he does not want to lose hope. Nevertheless, even he got disappointed. Referring to this, the BNP secretary general said, “When I want to see a progressive society, when I want a fair system to establish people’s rights, when I want to reduce public inequality… if I then see completely different thoughts being imposed, attempts to divert people’s thinking, and efforts to spread extremism, naturally that leads to frustration.” The BNP secretary general recommended reforms to the state structure to ensure social protection for marginalised communities. He said, \"These problems cannot be solved piecemeal or with patchwork fixes. What’s needed is clear thinking and defined goals.\" The BNP leader said that education, health, employment, and agriculture are not isolated issues. He stated that all these matters depend on the state structure. He explained that everything is contingent on who the public elects and how those who are elected govern the country. Mirza Fakhrul further stated that the Awami League has ruined the country and destroyed its institutions over the past 15 years. He added that it should not be expected that this damage can be recovered in just a year and a half. Citing rampant corruption as a key reason behind the country's political crisis, the BNP secretary general said, \"MPs have taken over the work of upazila chairmen, which is not their responsibility. Instead of legislating, they brought up road and building development, and even whether cars will be purchased. The state's system itself has become one of occupation.\" He also remarked that everything is under the control of bureaucracy. \"Even the advisers have become helpless in some cases,\" he added. “Even a teacher from the rural areas has to come to Dhaka to resolve a problem now. This was not necessary. The system is to blame for this. If a rural area teacher does not come to the centre, then where will the bribe come from?\" he asked. He added that university teachers, school teachers, and nurses are all appointed through bribes. Among the others who addressed the event are - Sohrab Hasan, joint editor of Prothom Alo; economist M Masrur Reaz; Zonayed Saki, chief coordinator of Ganasamhati Andolan; Bobby Hajjaj, chairman of the  Nationalist Democratic Movement; and former member of parliament Rehana Akhter Ranu. The meeting was moderated by Bithika Binte Hossain, chairman of the Arpon Alok Sangha.",

    "content": "The post-mortem examination of senior journalist Bibhuranjan Sarkar has been completed. It was carried out around 11:30 am today, Saturday, at the morgue of Munshiganj General Hospital, in the presence of police and family members. Sheikh Md Ehsanul Islam, the resident medical officer (RMO) of Munshiganj General Hospital, who conducted the post-mortem, said that there were no external or internal injury marks found on Bibhuranjan’s body. Speaking to reporters around 11:30 am after the post-mortem, Md Ehsanul Islam said, “The body was recovered from water. It showed early signs of decomposition. As far as we could see, there were no external or internal injuries.” “However, we have collected some samples including teeth, hair, liver, kidneys, and stomach. These will be preserved and sent to Dhaka for further examination. Will we be able to give a final opinion only after receiving those reports,” he added. Seventy-one-year-old Bibhuranjan Sarkar was working as senior assistant editor of the daily Ajker Patrika. He had gone missing after leaving his residence in Siddheshwari area of Dhaka, around 10:00 am on Thursday. That night, his family filed a general diary (GD) with Ramna Police Station, reporting his disappearance. On Friday afternoon, a body was seen floating in the Meghna River in Balakir Char area of Gazaria upazila in Munshiganj. Locals then called the national emergency helpline 999. Led by Inspector Mohammad Saleh Ahmed of Kalagachhia River Police Outpost, a police team went to the spot and recovered the body at around 3:45 pm. In the evening, the body was sent to the morgue of Munshiganj General Hospital for post-mortem. The Kalagachhia River Police Outpost took photographs of the body and sent them to Ramna Police Station in Dhaka. Police then matched the images with those provided by Bibhuranjan’s family, confirming his identity. Later, his son Hrit Sarkar and brother Chiranjan Sarkar went to Munshiganj and formally identified the body. After completing formal procedures, the police handed over the body to family members around 1:00 pm today. Those who received it included his younger brother Chiranjan Sarkar, Ajker Patrika’s admin coordinator SM Selim, Chiranjan’s friend Tahmiduzzaman, Azma Hai, and Monon Morshed. The body was then transported in a freezer van to his Siddheshwari residence in the capital. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Chiranjan Sarkar said, “We have taken custody of my brother’s body. We will take it to his Siddheshwari home in Dhaka. After the family sees his body, the funeral rites will be performed at the Bordeshwari Kali Temple and crematorium in Sabujbagh area of Dhaka.” On the matter of filing a case, Chiranjan Sarkar added, “We haven’t made any decision yet. After completing the funeral rites, the family will sit together, discuss, and then decide.” Inspector Mohammad Saleh Ahmed of Kalagachhia River Police Outpost said, “The body was formally handed over to family members around 1:00 pm. An unnatural death case will be filed. If anything significant is revealed in the post-mortem, further legal action will follow.” Visiting Bibhuranjan’s ancestral home in Nagarkumari (Uttarpara) area under Boda upazila in Panchagarh around 9:30 pm on Friday night, his 95-year-old mother, Madhobilata Sarkar, was found sitting quietly in a room. Watching the constant stream of relatives and neighbours arriving at the house, she kept asking why they had come. Family members told her they had only come to visit and had not yet broken the news of her son’s death. In this ancestral home in Boda, Bibhoranjan’s mother lives with three younger sons, their wives and children along with the wife and children of his late elder son. While speaking last night, his younger brother Monoranjan Sarkar, treasurer of Boda Press Club, said, “My mother is old and unwell. That is why we haven’t told her about my brother’s death yet. But seeing so many people at the house, she keeps asking why they are here. We are thinking of informing her on Saturday before the body arrives.”",

    "title": "18th Teacher Registration Exam results: Nearly 60,000 teaching positions vacant, what NTRCA will do",
    "content": "The final results of the 18th Teacher Registration Examination have been announced. A total of 1,865,719 candidates applied. After a lengthy process, only 41,000 candidates have been recommended. However, the demand for vacant positions from across the country was 182,200. As a result, nearly 60,000 positions remain vacant in private educational institutions. People involved in education expressed surprise at the failure to fill such a large number of vacancies. They said qualified candidates are not being found comparing to the vast number of applicants, and that raises new questions about the quality of the education system. According to the information from the Non-Government Teacher Registration and Certification Authority (NTRCA), a total of 1,340,833 candidates participated in the preliminary examination of the 18th Teacher Registration. Among them, 479,981 candidates passed. A total of 348,680 candidates took the written exam and 83,865 of them passed. 81,209 candidates participated in the viva examination, and ultimately 60,634 candidates passed. However, despite passing the examination, it was not possible to recommend everyone for recruitment. The NTRCA has stated that approximately 20,000 successful candidates were not included in the list of recommendations due to failure to meet the recruitment conditions. Consequently, in the end, 41,000 individuals were recommended for employment. NTRCA member (joint secretary) Iradaul Haque told Prothom Alo. “We are not finding qualified candidates under. In many cases, candidates cannot even meet the eligibility requirements for teacher registration. There are nearly 8,000 vaccines for Moulvi posts at ibtedai level, but only 900 candidates have passed. Similarly, for the Assistant Teacher (Fine Arts) position, there are almost 9,000 vacant posts, but only 500 candidates have qualified. The biggest challenge right now is not being able to find qualified candidates.” Education experts say that the failure to fill such a large number of vacant posts raises questions about the quality of education in the country. They believe that a significant portion of highly educated young people are unable to survive in the competition of the job market. The results of the previous examinations by NTRCA are also indicating similar trends. In the 16th Teacher Registration Examination, about 950,000 candidates participated, out of which only 18,500 were finally successful. In the 17th Teacher Registration, 2,410,962 candidates applied, but only 23,000 candidates ultimately passed. Although the pass rate in the 18th registration is somewhat higher, it is still insufficient to meet the demand for filling the positions. A recent report from the task force on inclusive and sustainable development said the unemployment rate is highest among the highly educated in the country. Among every 100 unemployed individuals, 28 are highly educated. The results of the teacher registration exam also clearly reflect that reality. Professor S M Hafizur Rahman of the Institute of Education and Research at Dhaka University told Prothom Alo that there have been questions about the quality of education for many years. The inability to find qualified candidates for teacher recruitment is exacerbating this issue. For 182,200 positions, only 41,000 recommendations have been received. So, 60,000 positions remain vacant. In the 16th and 17th Teacher Registration Examinations, there were also vacant positions. How can our educational institutions function with such a large number of vacancies? This is currently a big question. A special teacher recruitment exam should be conducted on an urgent basis to fill all vacant positions. However, before that, teachers’ salaries, promotions, transfers, and other benefits need to be increased. If steps are not taken to improve teachers’ living standards, talented individuals will not join the teaching profession. Every year, positions will remain unfilled. Academicians believe that the high number of applicants for the teacher registration exam, reaching into the hundreds of thousands, without a corresponding number of qualified candidates, serves as a major warning for the country's educational system. According to them, merely possessing a degree is not sufficient to become a teacher; one also needs the right skills, subject-specific knowledge, and systematic teaching abilities. A senior official from the Ministry of Education, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated, ''The challenges we face in teacher recruitment are actually a reflection of the entire educational system. If we fail to ensure quality education from primary to university level, this crisis will only deepen.'' It is feared that many institutions will face a shortage of teachers in the upcoming academic year due to nearly 60,000 vacancies remaining unfilled in the 18th Teacher Registration Examination. However, the NTRCA has stated that efforts will be made to gradually fill these positions th",

    "title": "Rohingya genocide case to proceed",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly inv",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "title": "Yet-to-start mega projects: Consider putting  them on hold",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The High Court yesterday came down hard on Bangladesh Railway for mismanagement, ticket scalping and carrying passengers on the train roofs. \"If any train carries passengers on its roof, appropriate actions will be taken against the officials concerned,\" said the court. The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendations",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers.

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver.

    "title": "Energy crisis: Piecemeal steps won’t solve it",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "title": "Parties can’t be forced to join nat’l polls: CEC",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280.

He was 83. He breathed his last around 1:30pm while undergoing treatment at Anwar Khan Modern Medical College Hospital in Dhaka, Khalid Saifullah, a senior reporter of the newspaper, told The Daily Star. Mohiuddin had fallen ill at home on May 30 and was taken to the hospital, he said. After showing signs of recovery, he was discharged and taken home a few days later. Last week, when his condition deteriorated again, he was readmitted to the same hospital, said Khalid. Doctors said he had been suffering from multiple health complications, including urine-related problems, breathing difficulties, and fluctuating blood pressure. His namaz-e-janaza was held after Maghrib prayers yesterday at the Krishi Laboratories Mosque in the capital's Monipuri Para. He will be buried at the Rayerbazar Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard. Born in Natore, Mohiuddin completed his graduation in English from Rajshahi University. He is survived by two daughters, relatives, friends and admirers.

The BNP leader said it is impossible to expect a functional democracy and just society without restructuring the existing state system, which, he said, fosters inequalities and corruption. Fakhrul highlighted how bureaucratic centralisation forces citizens, including schoolteachers, to come to Dhaka even for minor issues that could be resolved at the district level. This system, he alleged, is designed to sustain bribery and rent-seeking, extending from recruitment in schools to universities. He also said inequalities, rooted in Bangladesh's state structure for decades, cannot be eradicated overnight, though structural reforms are essential. \"Instant solutions to long-standing issues of injustice, corruption, authoritarianism and structural discrimination cannot be expected,\" he said. Fakhrul said reforms of the state framework and the electoral process are still at a preliminary stage. He said the recent mass uprising has opened a new opportunity for change, but cautioned that sustainable reforms require well-defined planning, political sincerity and structural change. The seminar, titled \"How Well is Social Protection Secured\", was organised by Arpon Alok Songho.

Giving the July charter precedence over the constitution would set a \"negative\" precedent, the BNP said in its official feedback on the final draft prepared by the National Consensus Commission. The party also opposes any provision that legal challenges regarding this charter cannot be brought before the court. Giving the July charter precedence over the constitution is illogical and unacceptable. \n\n\n\n\n— BNP Standing Committee Member Salahuddin Ahmed \nBNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed said the bid to make the July charter supersede the constitution is \"illogical and unacceptable\".\n\"Can a consensus document be treated as a 'supra-constitutional instrument' -- one that stands above the Constitution itself?\"\nIf it is declared that all provisions of this document will take precedence over the Constitution, it would set a negative precedent for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Creating such a precedent for the entire nation would not be appropriate,\" he added.\n\n\nThe July charter must be given preference over the constitution as it contains all the aspirations and expectations of the nation and the people. — Jamaat AGS Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair\nOn the other hand, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami supported the commission's proposal that the charter will take precedence in case of conflict between the charter and the existing laws or the constitution.\n\"Because the July Charter contains all the aspirations and expectations of the nation and the people,\" Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair, assistant secretary general of Jamaat, told The Daily Star.\nMany big changes were incorporated in the July charter in comparison to the constitution.\n\"That's why the July charter must be given preference over the constitution,\" he said.\n\"Since the method by which all provisions, principles, and decisions of this charter would be incorporated into the constitution has not been specified, we do not agree with this clause,\" said Javed Rasin, joint convenor of the National Citizen Party.\nAll provisions, principles, and decisions of this Charter must be incorporated into the Constitution through a constituent assembly election, the party proposed.\n\"All recommendations should be implemented before the election and formalised through a constituent assembly,\" he said, adding that there should be a provision in the new constitution that bars any amendment conflicting with the July charter.\nThe new constitution should function as the guiding principle for resolving all categories of national issues, he said.\nThe Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal (Marxist) and the 12-Party Alliance all opposed the Commission's proposal to grant the July Charter precedence over the Constitution and existing laws.\nCPB in its feedback said they had proposed excluding the four principles enshrined in the Constitution from the discussion as consensus on the issues was not possible.\n\"For this reason, we decisively boycotted the meeting. Yet, without consulting us, there has been an implicit attempt to secure our consent to alter those fundamental principles. This is entirely unacceptable,\" it said.\nMojibur Rahman Monju, chairman of AB Party, said they proposed for the third round of meetings of the National Consensus Commission on the issue of giving constitutional status and legal basis to the July Charter.\n\"The implementation process of the July Charter must begin immediately, because we demand that the upcoming 13th National Assembly elections be held based on the July Charter,\" he said.\nRegarding the implementation timeline of the July charter, Salahuddin said that the election schedule will be announced in mid-December. Until then, the few months available are sufficient for drafting laws and regulations.\n\"All ordinances can be issued within one or one and a half months, and executive orders can be implemented. It would be better not to include the phrase \"before the national parliamentary election\" in the charter.\"\nBut issues related to constitution changes should be implemented through the next national parliament, he said.\nJamaat and NCP said they prefer full implementation of the charter before the next general polls.\nAli Riaz, vice-chairman of the National Consensus Commission, said they will soon sit with experts to discuss the process of making the charter legally binding and explore ways for its implementation.\n\"We will also hold discussions with political parties,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, NCP Member Secretary Akhtar Hossain yesterday said that without providing and implementing a legal basis, the 'July Charter' will fail to contain people's aspiration for freedom.\nIf the Co",

    "title": "Govt to buy potato directly from farmers this year",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured The government has decided to procure potatoes directly from farmers this year in a bid to ensure fair prices for growers amid a sharp decline in domestic rates due to higher production. The government will set potato prices at the cold storage level and purchase the tuber directly from farmers, said Agriculture Adviser Lieutenant General (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury. The move was taken to cut out middlemen and ensure more benefits for the growers, he said. Chowdhury shared the information at a press conference after visiting the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation's (BADC) cold storage, central seed testing laboratory, and vegetable seed processing centre at Gabtoli in Dhaka yesterday. The BADC, a corporation under the agriculture ministry, works on the production of high-yielding seeds of different crops, preservation and supply enhancement, along with irrigation technology development. The government is yet to decide how much potato will be procured, Mohammad Zakir Hossain, senior information officer at the agriculture ministry, said at the event. A meeting will be held soon to finalise the amount, he said. At the beginning of the season, many farmers were forced to sell their produce at the field level for as low as Tk 11 per kilogramme (kg), far lower than the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimated average production cost of Tk 14. Moreover, in some northern regions, where cultivation costs run higher, production expenses reached up to Tk 20 per kg, according to DAE data. Bangladesh produced 1.15 crore tonnes of potatoes, the highest in history, in the last harvesting season, according to estimates by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). An expansion of cultivation area and higher yield owing to favourable weather boosted the overall production of the popular vegetable this year, said the BBS. Farmers grew the tuber on 4.92 lakh hectares in the 2024-25 fiscal year, up 8 percent year-on-year. At the press meet, the agriculture adviser also discussed Bangladesh's reliance on imports. The tissue culture of potatoes, pineapples, dates, and various flowers is being carried out at BADC's tissue culture centre, he said. \"We import dates from abroad. If saplings produced through this technology are widely distributed locally, dependence on imports will decrease,\" he said. \"We have to buy potato seeds at high prices from countries like the Netherlands. If we can produce high-quality potato seeds inside Bangladesh, it will be beneficial for our agriculture.\" He added that BADC's tissue culture lab is working towards this goal. If agricultural research is strengthened, Bangladesh will no longer need to import seed potatoes from abroad, and production costs will decrease further, he said. About the recent price hikes, the adviser said vegetable fields were damaged due to rain, which has affected the market. \"Once the weather returns to normal, this problem will go away.\" In response to a journalist's question about reducing dependence on jute seed imports, Chowdhury said farmers prefer growing other, more profitable crops than jute. Jute seeds take a long time to grow, during which farmers can harvest paddy two to three times, he said. And it has not been possible to meet the demand for jute seeds through local production because of land scarcity, the adviser said, hinting at the continuation of jute seed imports. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured As Rucsu polls are set to take place after 35 years, protests, disputes and various demands have gripped the campus. Since the election date was announced in late July, student organisations have been scrambling to secure positions as both excitement and tensions stir across the university. While some groups prepare to contest independently, others are forming coalitions to boost their chances. But internal conflicts, leadership crises, and unresolved demands have cast uncertainty on whether the polls will proceed smoothly. Student bodies including Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, Islami Chhatra Shibir, left-leaning alliances, and independents have already begun campaigning, though divisions and allegations against the administration threaten to derail the process. With only four of its top leaders listed as voters, Chhatra Dal is struggling with a leadership crisis. The studentships of its President Sultan Ahmed Rahi and General Secretary Sardar Jahurul expired earlier, making them ineligible to contest. The organisation intends to field its own panel but has kept the option of alliances open. Organising Secretary Mahmudul Hasan Mithu is the likely vice-president candidate, while Nafiul Jibon, Jahin Biswas Esha, and Gazi Ferdous Hasan are also in the race for other posts. Chhatra Dal earlier announced it would join the polls only if its demands were met: shifting polling centres to academic buildings instead of residential halls, removing Jamaat-linked teachers from provost posts, and taking legal and administrative action against Awami League-leaning teachers. RU Chhatra Dal President Sultan Ahmed Rahi said, \"The university administration has failed to ensure the participation of all political organisations. The election should have been arranged through discussions, like in the case of Ducsu. This election has no meaning before the trial of the fascist teachers. The administration must very soon announce a new schedule after discussions with everyone.\" The organisation has also threatened protests if demands are ignored. RU's Islami Chhatra Shibir has re-emerged after the 2024 political shift. Although its influence has grown with Jamaat-backed individuals in the administration, Shibir will not contest under its own banner and is preparing to run as part of an \"Anti-Fascist Inclusive Panel\" to attract students from diverse backgrounds. Its President Mostakur Rahman Zahid is expected to contest for vice-president, while General Secretary Mujahid Faisal and Najmus Shakib are likely candidates for general secretary and assistant general secretary. However, leaders have been instructed to include general students in the panel, even if it means ceding top posts. Mujahid Faisal said, \"We had been kept away from the general students for a long time. However, after August 5, we have been able to mix with them. The misconceptions that general students had about Shibir have been broken. That's why we are hopeful about winning the election.\" Meanwhile, left-leaning organisations continue to struggle with limited campus support. This time, they are pushing for broader coalition with cultural groups. Fuad Ratul of the Socialist Students' Front is tipped as their vice-president candidate, alongside contenders Nasim Sarkar, Tarek Ashraf, Kaisar Ahmed, Alif Shahriar, and Shamim Tripura. However, they too have pre-polls demands, including keeping polling centres at academic buildings, forming a cyberbullying prevention cell, and cancelling voting rights for accused attackers. On August 14, they observed a hunger strike, but the administration did not respond. Ratul said, \"We had placed several demands regarding Rucsu before the administration, but none of them have been accepted…. Our position is clear: if our demands are not met, we will move towards a tougher movement.\" Rucsu treasurer Setaur Rahman said, \"Student organisations are regularly presenting their demands. We're constantly reviewing them. We're also sitting with the student organisations for discussions. However, it isn't possible for the administration to meet all the demands.\" Meanwhile, Professor Md Amzad Hossain has resigned as chief election commissioner of the Rucsu polls. A professor of the finance department, he was appointed as a member of the Bangladesh Public Service Commission on Wednesday, after which he submitted his resignation letter to the university's Vice-Chancellor and Rucsu President Professor Saleh Hasan Naqib, confirmed Acting Registrar Dr Iftikharul Alam Masud. POLLS AFTER 3 DECADES Rucsu was founded in 1962, a decade after the university's establishment. Since then, 14 elections have been held, the last in 1989.

Durjoy's father, Komol Chowdhury, speaking at a human chain in front of Cox's Bazar Press Club this morning, said his son was detained without any case or warrant. Komol's son Durjoy worked as an office assistant at a government high school. He accused the school's headteacher Rabeya Khanom and senior teacher Jasim Uddin of involvement in the alleged killing. He said the headteacher had accused Durjoy of financial fraud and warned him over the phone. \"I told her I would repay every penny, even if my son lost his job, but not to harm him. He could not bear the humiliation,\" Komol said.

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Kevin De Bruyne scored on his Napoli debut on Saturday as the Serie A champions kicked off their title defence with a straightforward 2-0 win at promoted Sassuolo. The headline signing of the summer transfer window in Italy, De Bruyne opened his account for Napoli in the 57th minute when his free-kick swept in from the left flank and evaded everyone before nestling in the far corner. De Bruyne made sure Napoli would get off to a winning start to the new season in Reggio Emilia after Scott McTominay continued where he left off from last season with a bullet header in the 17th minute. McTominay was the star of Napoli's second Scudetto triumph in three years with 12 goals and again looked in fine form for Antonio Conte's team. The Scotland midfielder was unlucky not to double his tally for the evening on the stroke of half-time when his rasping first-time effort crashed onto the crossbar. Napoli have never retained a league title, not even when Diego Maradona strutted his stuff in southern Italy back in the 1980s, and their attempt to do so after the historic success of 2023 ended with a 10th-place finish. However unlike Luciano Spalletti, whose exit straight after winning the league destabilised Napoli, Conte has decided to stay put and that has given fans hopes of another big season. The current team will have to play the first few months of Napoli's bid for a fifth league crown without Romelu Lukaku. De Bruyne's Belgium teammate could be out of action until the end of the year with a thigh muscle tear and his understudy Lorenzo Lucca struggled to get into the game on his Napoli debut. Sassuolo romped to the Serie B title last term but were outclassed on their return to the top flight, and finished the match with 10 men after debutant Ismael Kone was sent off in the 79th minute for two bookable offences. Later, Luka Modric will start AC Milan's first fixture of the campaign against promoted Cremonese as the veteran star begins a new chapter in northern Italy after 13 trophy-laden years at Real Madrid. Roma face an old foe in their first official fixture under new coach Gian Piero Gasperini, with former Lazio striker Ciro Immobile making his Bologna debut. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "title": "Gyokeres scores twice as Arsenal rout Leeds",
    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Viktor Gyokeres scored his first two Arsenal goals as the Gunners gave Leeds a harsh lesson in the step up to the Premier League with a 5-0 win at the Emirates. Victory came at a cost for Mikel Arteta as Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard hobbled off injured just eight days before Arsenal's trip to Liverpool. Arsenal edged ahead of north London rivals Tottenham at the top of the table on goal difference, as the only two sides so far with a 100 percent record from their opening two games. Saka fired in a blistering strike from a narrow angle to double the home side's lead after Jurrien Timber opened the scoring. Gyokeres was signed from Sporting Lisbon as the solution to Arsenal's need for a killer number nine. The Swede's ability to succeed in the Premier League has been questioned despite his prolific record of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting. Gyokeres made his mark with a fine individual run and finish before Timber bundled in his second from another Declan Rice corner. Gyokeres rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot with virtually the last kick of the game. A day of celebration for the home fans began before kick-off when new £60 million ($81 million) signing Eberechi Ezi was paraded after he turned down a move to Tottenham. But the sight of captain Odegaard and talisman Saka leaving the field soured a routine win. Arsenal had to rely on their threat from set-pieces to grind out a 1-0 win at Manchester United on the opening weekend of the season. Despite a dominant start to the game, that was how the the Leeds defence was prized open. Timber had scored just twice in 52 Arsenal appearances before Saturday. The Dutch international doubled that tally as he firstly got his head to Rice's inviting delivery on 34 minutes. Odegaard then made his departure after appearing to injure his shoulder falling heavily to the turf. Saka soon had the Emirates crowd back on their feet when he drilled Timber's pass high past Lucas Perri with his supposedly weaker right foot. Gyokeres had at one point been a target for Leeds during his days with Coventry in the Championship before making the move to Portugal. Arsenal's new £66 million signing showed the Yorkshire side what they missed as he scampered onto Riccardo Calafiori's ball over the top and cut inside before firing in at the near post. Saka missed nearly four months of last season with a hamstring injury. Worryingly for Arteta, the England international was holding the back of his left leg when he was replaced on 53 minutes. Arsenal added a fouth when Leeds failed to clear another Rice corner and Timber forced the ball over the line from close range. Arteta could then afford the luxury of handing a Premier League debut to 15-year-old Max Dowman. He became the second youngest ever player to play in the English top-flight after team-mate Ethan Nwaneri. Dowman's trickery won a penalty deep into stoppage time that Gyokeres gratefully dispatched. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Arsenal have completed the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace, it was announced Saturday, with the England international returning to his boyhood club. No fee was disclosed but Eze has signed a four-year contract in a deal that could be worth up to £68 million ($92 million) after Arsenal scuppered Eze's proposed move to their arch north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur. \"We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal,\" said Gunners manager Mikel Arteta. \"He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today. \"His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.\" Eze becomes Arsenal's seventh signing of a summer transfer window where they have now spent some £250 million following the arrivals of Viktor Gyokeres, Cristhian Mosquera, Martin Zubimendi, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Christian Norgaard and Noni Madueke. Arsenal have finished second in the Premier League for each of the past three seasons and last won a trophy five years ago. But Eze's signing is a further indication of their determination to end a 22-year wait for the Premier League title. Arsenal's move -– for a reported initial fee of £60 million prior to performance related add-ons –- sees Eze returning to his boyhood club, with the 27-year-old having started his career at the Gunners' academy before being released. His signing was announced shortly before Arsenal's first Premier League home game of the season, against Leeds, on Saturday. Eze arrives at the Emirates assured of a place in Palace history after scoring the winning goal in the Eagles' FA Cup final victory against Manchester City in May to secure the south London club's first major trophy. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Bayer Leverkusen let a one-goal lead slip to lose 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim in new coach Erik Ten Hag's Bundesliga debut on Saturday. Taking over from Xabi Alonso in the summer and overseeing a radically restructured side after several high-profile exits, the former Manchester United manager cut a frustrated figure on the sideline. Leverkusen hit the lead after six minutes when Jarell Quansah, who arrived from Liverpool this summer, headed in a Alex Grimaldo free kick. Hoffenheim, who finished just one spot above the relegation placings last season, levelled with 25 minutes played, Fisnik Asllani taking advantage of a defensive error from Quansah. Tim Lemperle put the visitors ahead after 52 minutes. He was given too much time by Leverkusen's defence and skidded a low shot across the grass and into the corner. Leverkusen lost just three league games in the past two seasons, but there would be no late heroics. The defeat showed the scale of the rebuild Ten Hag has on his hands. Eintracht Frankfurt proved they still know their way to goal without departed striker Hugo Ekitike, thumping Werder Bremen 4-1 at home, Jean-Matteo Bahoya scoring a brace before half-time. Now at Liverpool, Ekitike scored 15 and added eight assists in the league last season, but youngsters Bahoya, Can Uzun and Ansgar Knauff all scored for the home side in a dominant victory. Bremen pulled one back through Justin Njinmah in the second half but rarely troubled the hosts. German Cup holders Stuttgart were beaten by Union Berlin, who won 2-1 thanks to a first-half double from debutant Ilyas Ansah. Back in Berlin for the first time since winning the cup final in May, Stuttgart hit the woodwork twice and had a stoppage-time equaliser to Nick Woltemade ruled out for offside. Elsewhere, Augsburg won 3-1 at Freiburg and Wolfsburg won by the same scoreline at Heidenheim. On Friday, defending champions Bayern Munich exploded in their season opener, beating RB Leipzig 6-0 at home, with Harry Kane scoring a second-half hat trick.

For some athletes, the barriers begin long before the starting gun is fired. On the second day of the 17th National Summer Athletics Championships on Saturday, Roksana Begum sprinted through the finish line in the women's 100m hurdles with a time of 15 seconds -- a performance that crowned her champion yet again. It's the second time this year she has taken the national title in this event, having won earlier in February. But the track is only a small part of Roksana's story. She grew up in Sonapur, a quiet corner of Noakhali, where dreams don't often stretch as far as national stadiums. Her father drove a microbus, and with three brothers and a sister depending on her, Roksana became the family's main source of income. Since 2020, she has served in the Bangladesh Army -- a job that not only allows her to support her loved ones but also keeps her athletic ambitions alive. \"My salary from the army helps me take care of my family,\" she said after winning her race at the National Stadium's athletics track. Her journey into sports began with long jump, guided by coach Rafiqullah Milon. He later encouraged her to take up hurdles -- a suggestion that would shape her career. But getting to this point wasn't just about athletic training. She had to overcome the questions thrown at her in her village. \"People didn't understand. They questioned what I was doing, where I was going,\" Roksana recalled. \"They didn't know I was training.\" Across the men's field, Tanvir Faisal, also representing the Bangladesh Army, claimed his third straight title in the men's 110m hurdles. It's a feat few can match, yet Tanvir knows his discipline doesn't always get the recognition it deserves. \"We're athletes too, just like the 100m sprinters. But the spotlight rarely falls on us,\" he exclaimed. For Tanvir, hurdles are more than an event. \"Athletics is about struggle. You can see that just by looking at me,\" he joked. \"But I love it. Hurdles are where I belong.\" His latest win added another gold to his name, but it's the first title that still lights up his memory. \"Nothing beats the first time. That joy -- you don't forget it.\" As the championships come to a conclusion on Sunday, names will fade from the headlines. But for Roksana and Tanvir, the real stories aren't written on leaderboards. They're found in early-morning training runs, in overcoming doubts, in chasing a future that once seemed out of reach. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

Brennan Johnson and Joao Palhinha struck for the Europa League winners just before half-time as Spurs went top of the table, making it a perfect start for Thomas Frank after two league games in charge. \"Extremely proud of the players, exceptionally good performance,\" said Frank. \"The mentality is the key thing. We need this mentality to win games like this.\" City's run of four consecutive titles came to a spectacular end last season as they finished a distant third behind Liverpool and Arsenal. A 4-0 thrashing of Wolves on the opening weekend of the campaign showed glimpses of a new-look City back to their best. However, a series of defensive issues remain unresolved, while manager Pep Guardiola must decide on who will be his number one goalkeeper going forward after a day to forget for James Trafford. \"We missed the simple things,\" lamented Guardiola. \"Of course we have to improve, but I said the same after Wolves.\" Trafford retained his place in goal despite the return to fitness of Ederson. The Brazilian is reportedly on the verge of joining Turkish giants Galatasaray, which would free up City to make a move for out-of-favour Paris Saint-Germain 'keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. City's failure to get those deals done before the final week of the transfer window came back to haunt them in a familiar tale for Guardiola's men against Tottenham. In the last 13 Premier League meetings between the sides, City have won just four despite several changes of management at Spurs in that time. City's high line exposed Frank is the latest man in the Tottenham dug out and has made a highly impressive start. Spurs were minutes away from beating PSG in the UEFA Super Cup, before losing on penalties, and have taken maximum points from their opening two Premier League games without conceding. City's high line was easily exposed in an embarrassing early exit from the Club World Cup to Saudi side Al-Hilal last month and is an issue Guardiola still has to resolve. Tottenham took the lead on 35 minutes when Mohammed Kudus fed Richarlison and he squared for Johnson to power past Trafford. An offside flag briefly halted Spurs' joy until a VAR review showed the slipping Ruben Dias had played Richarlison onside. City then completely lost their composure for the period before half-time. Trafford was fortunate to avoid being punished after rushing outside his box to block from Kudus with his arm. But the 22-year-old then endured a moment which might cost him the chance to be Guardiola's number one this season. Trafford's attempted pass to Nico Gonzalez inside his own box was intercepted by Pape Mate Sarr and even though the goalkeeper recovered to deny Richarlison, Palhinha smashed home the rebound. Erling Haaland had the chance to reduce City's arrears in first-half stoppage time, but headed over to sum up a tough afternoon for the Norwegian. Spurs let a two-goal lead slip late on against PSG in Frank's first game in charge, but rarely looked in danger of suffering a similar fate. Haaland wasted City's other big opportunity to gain a foothold when he overhit a pass to Rayan Cherki with just Guglielmo Vicario to beat. But City fell to defeat with a whimper and could have been further punished on the counter-attack when Trafford made good saves to deny Dominic Solanke and Wilson Odobert in stoppage time. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

The Nurul Hasan Sohan-led side had entered the contest with a glimmer of hope after Australian Capital Territory defeated Melbourne Stars Academy earlier in the day, leaving Bangladesh A with a chance to progress to the semis on net run rate. However, that opportunity quickly slipped away once Strikers' openers took control of the chase. Batting first at Marrara Cricket Ground, Bangladesh A posted 175 for four. Jisan Alam struck his second half-century of the tournament, making a 38-ball 50, featuring four boundaries and a maximum. Afif Hossain, consistent throughout the competition but once again denied a fifty, smashed an unbeaten 25-ball 49, including five fours and three sixes. Yasir Ali provided finishing touches with a 15-ball 25. To advance, however, Bangladesh needed to restrict Strikers Academy to 122 or fewer. That equation was settled within the first 13 overs of the reply. Openers Mackenzie Harvey and Jake Winter put on 123 runs, with Winter contributing a run-a-ball 35 before falling. Harvey, the nephew of former Australian cricketer Ian Harvey, proved unstoppable. The left-hander smashed an unbeaten 53-ball 102, laced with 15 fours and a six, steering Strikers to 176 for three in 18.4 overs and sealing their semifinal berth. Bangladesh A ended their campaign with two wins from six matches. The semifinal lineup was confirmed with Strikers Academy joining Kingsmen, Pakistan Shaheens, and Perth Scorchers Academy. In a campaign where batters struggled to display a good account of themselves, Jisan came through, often giving Bangladesh good starts at the top. He top-scored for his side with 208 runs at a strike-rate of 138.67 in six matches. With the ball, it was left-arm spinner Rakibul Islam who impressed, scalping 10 wickets at an economy rate of 6.71. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola has aimed a dig at other top Premier League clubs for having outspent his side in the summer window. This summer, Liverpool are the top spenders in England, having forked out around €340 million (£295m) on transfers. Chelsea are the second-biggest spenders at €280m (£243m), Arsenal will be around the €300m mark when they sign Eberechi Eze. Manchester United, eyeing a transformation under Ruben Amorim, have already spent over €225m (£195m). Manchester City, however, have spent around €177m (£153m), almost half of Liverpool's spendings. \"I don't know, but the clubs spend with the strict financial rules [of PSR] and they will only spend if they can do it. Apparently It's not just Manchester City [who are spending],\" Guardiola poked fun at City's rivals in a recent media interaction. \"Everyone does what they believe is the best for the team. I know our net spend for the last 10-11 years is amazing. You don't spend if you don't sell. We have been really good, that's why they're sustainable,\" he added. So far, £2.37bn ($3.2bn) has been paid out by top-flight clubs in England in this summer window.

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Coco Gauff says she didn't hesitate to shake up her team just days before the US Open, hoping a new specialist coach can help shore up the serve that has been letting her down. \"It was a very sudden decision\" to hire biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan, Gauff acknowledged on Friday as she spoke to reporters ahead of the final Grand Slam of the year. \"Gavin became available. I just felt this was the best decision for my game at least and I had to go with what I was feeling.\" She had kind parting words for former coach Matt Daly, but clearly thinks that MacMillan -- who helped world number one Aryna Sabalenka sort out a slumping serve -- has the expertise she needs. \"I'm just looking at long term,\" said the world number three, who won her first Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows in 2023. She added a second at the French Open this year, but has been inconsistent since, with her serve a major culprit. Gauff hit 42 double faults in just three matches at the Canadian Open in Montreal this month -- including 23 in a single encounter. She coughed up 16 double faults in her Cincinnati exit against Italy's Jasmine Paolini. \"I know Gavin has had experience with this before, so hoping I can just take on his knowledge and see what can happen,\" Gauff said. The timing, right before a major, wasn't a factor in the decision. \"A tournament is a tournament,\" Gauff said. \"I hate losing regardless of where I am. \"I hope I can get it all together -- I think I'll play either Monday or Tuesday -- by then. If not, I have the rest of this year to work on it. \"But I do know I needed to make a change, technical change to it, and I don't want to waste time continuing doing the wrong things.\" Defending US Open champion Sabalenka, whose serving woes threatened to derail her rise in 2022, credited MacMillan with putting her back on a path that has carried her to number one on the world. Like Gauff, she was at her wit's end when she went to MacMillan. \"I tried literally everything, and nothing would help me to fix my serve,\" Sabalenka recalled on Friday. \"It was the last step before I would say, OK, bye-bye, tennis. \"I was so desperate, so I wasn't really doubting my decision. The moment we start working, I felt like, 'OK, there is something. I definitely have a better feeling on my serve.' \"And I just trusted the process, trusted myself ... So for me, it was about repetitions, a little bit of time and full commitment to whatever he was saying.\" For Gauff, the move that surprised so many is about much more than one Grand Slam. \"I know where I want to see my game in the future,\" she said. \"I'm not going to waste time playing the way I don't want to play. \"I'm obsessed with the process of getting better. Sometimes maybe it hurts because I get obsessed with it too much. \"I feel like I have a clear future where I see myself and I feel like I'm really close.

The German said after his first-round exit at the All England Club that he felt \"alone\" and \"empty\" and \"lacking joy in everything that I do.\" But the 28-year-old said Friday that he was in a much better place as he prepares once again to vie for a first Grand Slam title in the final major of the year. \"Oh, I'm feeling a lot better,\" Zverev said. \"After Wimbledon (I) put my racket down and took extended time off and I went on holidays with my friends where I didn't train, didn't play tennis, didn't do anything to what I usually do. \"I went and had some time off. Spent a lot of time with my friends. Got professional help also, which I'm still working with now. \"Yeah, I'm on the right path.\" Zverev said he could feel the difference when he returned to action at the ATP Toronto Masters and the Cincinnati Open, reaching the semi-finals at both. \"I really enjoyed the last two tournaments. I really enjoyed being back on the tennis court,\" he said. \"I feel like everything is going in the right direction, and I'm very happy to be here right now.\" Zverev has come up empty in three Grand Slam finals, including a loss to Dominic Thiem at the 2020 US Open. He fell to Carlos Alcaraz in the 2024 Roland Garros final and to Jannik Sinner at the Australian Open this year. \"I'm looking for the last step, right,\" Zverev said \"I'm looking to lift one of those above my head once. That's what I'm looking for.\" To that end, he turned to retired Spanish great Rafael Nadal and his uncle Toni Nadal in the wake of his Wimbledon disappointment, hoping to come up with some improvements that can help him challenge top-ranked Sinner and Alcaraz. \"It's about finding ways to beat the best players in the world, right?\" Zverev said. \"It's about finding the right patterns, the right training to do that. \"That's why I went to see Uncle Toni and Rafa, because I wanted to see and then hear a new vision of what tennis in their mind looks like and how my tennis in their mind looks like. \"I think in tennis everybody can always improve,\" Zverev said. \"It's as simple as that.\" ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",

    "content": "Avijit murder convict Farabi freed on bail Body of missing journalist Bibhuranjan Sarker recovered from Meghna river ‘We knew nothing about any open letter’ Teen killed in mob violence on theft allegation, 2 others injured Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said on Friday his club cannot win in the saga over star striker Alexander Isak's future. The Swede, who was the Premier League's second top scorer last season and netted the winner to win the League Cup in March, went public this week on his desire to leave Tyneside, amid interest from Liverpool. Newcastle hit back with a statement of their own, denying Isak's claims that promises had been broken towards the player. According to reports, Isak had been promised an improved contract only for Newcastle to hold off due to pressures of meeting financial sustainability rules. Liverpool have reportedly had one bid of £110 million ($148 million) rejected, with the Magpies holding out for a British transfer record £150 million. The two clubs face off in the Premier League on Monday, but 25-year-old Isak will not be involved as he continues to train apart from the rest of the Newcastle squad. \"I think it is a lose-lose situation to a degree for us because I don't think we can come out of this winning in any situation,\" said Howe at his pre-match press conference. \"That is why I have said all summer, it is a difficult situation for the club to manage. \"We love Alex in the sense of what he has done for this football club since he has been here, what he has contributed, what he has given, how professional he's been and this has just been an unfortunate few months that looks like it is coming to an end. \"And it will come to an end pretty quickly and then we can focus on the football again.\" The transfer window will close on September 1 and Howe left the door open for Isak to be reintegrated into his squad for the rest of the season should a move not materialise. \"Alex is a fantastic player, he's a good person, a good character and a good lad,\" Howe added. \"If Alex wanted to come back and play for us the players would welcome him.\" One of the issues holding up a potential sale of their prized asset is Newcastle's inability to so far attract new strikers to St. James' Park. Brentford's Yoane Wissa and Wolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen are the two names currently on their wish list after failed moves for Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko and Joao Pedro among others. ঢাকায় সফররত পাকিস্তানের উপপ্রধানমন্ত্রী ও পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রীর সঙ্গে বৈঠকে জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টির (এনসিপি) নেতারা বলেছেন, বাংলাদেশ-পাকিস্তান সম্পর্ক এগিয়ে নিতে ৭১-ইস্যুকে ‘ডিল’ করা উচিত।",
