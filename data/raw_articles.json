    "title": "Do I deserve to be a victim of 'mob justice': BNP leader Fazlur Rahman",
    "content": "Recalling that he had fought the liberation war 54 years ago for the independence of the country, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Fazlur Rahman asked the nation whether he has the right to live in this country and whether the globally condemned practice of ‘mob justice’ can be carried out against him. If the answers are ‘no,’ he urged people to protest against such acts. Fazlur Rahman is an adviser to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. Yesterday, Sunday, the BNP served him a show-cause notice on allegations of making ‘indecent and misleading remarks’ about the July uprising. Since midnight, a group of people have been staging a protest in front of his Segunbagicha residence in the capital, demanding his arrest. In this situation, Supreme Court lawyer Fazlur Rahman spoke to newspersons at the court premises on Monday afternoon. Expressing concern for the safety of himself and his wife and children, he said, “O people of Bangladesh, I fought for you 54 years ago. Today, the very children who chant slogans against me—I fought to create an independent country for you. Do I deserve a dishonourable death at your hands?” Fazlur Rahman said, “If you think I am speaking against the country or opposing your actions, file a case against me, arrest me, punish me. But to create a mob at my own house to kill me, which for the past year in Bangladesh and in the world has become the most infamous name, ‘mob justice’, can it be carried out against me, and will it be carried out? I want to ask the people of Bangladesh this question.” Fazlur Rahman also held a press conference at the Law Reporters Forum office in front of the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association. He was accompanied by his wife and son at the press conference. He said, “People of Bangladesh, know this: my life is in great danger. I love the Liberation War; I love the people of my country… I am a human being. I have the right to live.” In response to a question on whether he would file a general diary (GD), BNP leader Fazlur Rahman said, “I will not file a GD; even if they kill me… I will not file any GD.” Fazlur Rahman further said, “My primary work is to do politics. I practice law to manage my personal life and livelihood. Yesterday an incident occurred. Around five 5:00pm I heard that the party had issued me a show-cause notice—my party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). At 9:00 pm, I received a document from the party. …I saw that the party had issued a show-cause notice against me for certain actions and statements, asking for a reply. This is a very normal occurrence. If a political party feels that one of its members has made some mistakes or deviations, it can issue a show-cause notice. They did so to me. I want to make it clear that I will respond to the party. I will tell the party everything it wants to know. Afterwards, the party will make its decision against me. But as of now, I am still within the party, and I remain an adviser to the party chairperson.” In reply to a question on whether he found any link between the show-cause notice and the students’ movement, Fazlur Rahman said, “I will not say now that I see a link with the show-cause. But they have already targeted many people… I am just Fazlur Rahman, an ordinary man; they are even throwing shoes at great people. …My point is, they will throw shoes, they will say things—that they will do. People will judge them. But coming in front of my house to kill me or to deny me my fundamental rights—I want to inform the nation of this. Let them throw shoes at me or hold processions, that they can do. If necessary, if I have said something against them, let them go and file a case against me.” In reply to another question, Fazlur Rahman said, “I have spoken about the security concerns of my life. I have the right to live in this country. I am a freedom fighter. …Now, regarding what is happening in front of my house, I am informing the nation, the country, and the security forces through you.”",

    "title": "Poverty rises to 28pc in 3 yrs, food costs 55pc",
    "content": "The poverty rate in the country currently stands at 27.93 per cent, or nearly 28 per cent while the rate was 18.7 per cent in 2022 as per the government data,. This scenario of poverty rise was revealed in a new study by the Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC). The findings of the study titled 'Economic Dynamics and Mood at Household Level in Mid-2025', was released at an event at the LGED auditorium in Agargaon, Dhaka, where PPRC executive chairman Hossain Zillur Rahman presented various aspects of the study. According to the PPRC study, extreme poverty has also increased. The study said that government data put the rate of extreme poverty at 5.6 per cent in 2022. By 2025, this has risen to 9.35 per cent. This means that over the past three years, poverty in the country has grown. At present, 18 per cent of families remain vulnerable to slipping into poverty at any time. The study was conducted last May, based on the opinions of 33,207 individuals from 8,067 families. The PPRC highlighted that the country is currently facing the combined impact of three types of crises: Covid-19 (2020–2022), inflation, and political-economic uncertainty. It also noted that while bribery has decreased since last August, it has not stopped. Before August 2024, 8.54 per cent of respondents reported paying bribes to receive services. After August, this figure fell to 3.69 per cent. The highest bribes were paid in government offices, followed by the police and political leaders. The PPRC study revealed that over the past three years, urban households’ monthly income has decreased, while expenses have gone up. The average monthly income of an urban household is now Tk 40,578, while expenses amount to Tk 44,961. In 2022, the average monthly income of an urban household was Tk 45,578. On the other hand, rural household incomes have risen somewhat. The average monthly income of a rural household is Tk 29,205, with expenses of Tk 27,162. In 2022, the average rural household income was Tk 26,163. Nationally, the average monthly household income stands at Tk 32,685, while expenses are Tk 32,615—leaving virtually no room for savings. The PPRC report also gave a breakdown of household expenditure. It found that nearly 55 per cent of a family’s monthly spending goes to food purchases. On average, a family spends Tk 10,614 on food each month. In addition, households spend Tk 1,822 on education, Tk 1,556 on healthcare, Tk 1,478 on transport, and Tk 1,089 on housing. Addressing the event, PPRC executive chairman Hossain Zillur Rahman analysed the overall situation. He said, “The interim government is focusing more on the macro economy than on the micro economy for valid reasons. But economic planning urgently requires a people’s lens. Discussions must not remain limited to GDP alone; we need to expand debates to include equity, justice, inclusivity, and citizen welfare.” He further said that five new vulnerable areas demand special attention in the existing reality. First, the growing burden of chronic illnesses calls for a new kind of social protection programme. Second, female-headed households, which still remain at the bottom of society, require special support. Third, rising burden of debt is becoming a major concern. Fourth, increasing food insecurity, which has not yet become widespread but is gradually worsening in an alarming way; and fifth, the sanitation crisis—Bangladesh has only five years left to achieve SDG targets, but about 36 per cent of people still use non-sanitary toilets. Ensuring safe sanitation has thus become crucial. On employment, Hossain Zillur Rahman added, “We are now facing an urgent employment situation. The country is living through the reality of a joblessness disaster. We need serious thought and immediate action to address employment issues. This requires urgent discussion and effective measures right now.”",

    "title": "Women do 3 to 4 times more household work than men",
    "content": "Women do four times more household work compared to men. The burden of such work is particularly high on women aged 15 to 24 as they spend about 20 hours a week on household chores, whereas men of the same age group spend only five hours a week. However, women in joint families tend to have a comparatively lower workload, giving them more opportunities to engage in productive work. This was revealed at a seminar titled “Care Responsibility and Women Work in Bangladesh,” organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) in Agargaon, Dhaka on Monday. Sajeda Amin, Senior Research Adviser of Sajeda Foundation, presented the keynote paper attended the event while UN Women’s Deputy Country Representative Navnita Sinha was present as the special guest with BIDS Director General AK Enamul Haque in the chair. In her presentation, Sajeda Amin said that women in joint families get two extra hours for productive work, and they spend nearly three hours less on household chores, allowing them more opportunities to engage in work outside the home. BIDS director general AK Enamul Haque said that women in the garment sector often have to walk more than a kilometer to reach their workplace. Because of the long commute, they cannot take their children with them. As a result, many childcare centres at factories remain unused. If workplaces were closer to home, these centres would be more useful. Former BIDS Research Director Rushidan Islam Rahman said that demand for women’s work needs to be created. At present, employment opportunities are limited, and the few that exist are largely taken by men. Therefore, more opportunities for women must be created in modern sectors such as technology. Researchers of BIDS and officials of Sajeda Foundation were present at the event.",

    "title": "National election 6 districts get new DCs, more to follow",
    "content": "The interim government has started reshuffling the field administration ahead of the upcoming national polls. The government appointed new deputy commissioners (DCs) to six districts. Three of them have been transferred to different districts. And three deputy secretaries have been appointed as the DCs in three other districts. There will be more changes in this significant post of the field administration, public administration ministry sources said. In particular, a massive reshuffle is likely to take place ahead of the declaration of the election schedule. The government is preparing a fit list to select efficient officers. So far, discussions indicate that the election will be held in February next year. In national elections, deputy commissioners (DCs) act as returning officers. However, the election commission (EC) has not yet given a final decision on whether DCs will serve as returning officers in the upcoming election. In the months leading up to the general election under the previous government, many districts saw changes in the post of DC. After last year’s mass uprising, the interim government withdrew the former DCs and gradually appointed new ones across all districts. However, the appointments at that time led to scuffles, chaos, and disorder among officials inside the secretariat. The postings of nine DCs were cancelled, and four others were reshuffled. Speaking to Prothom Alo, several public administration ministry officials said last month that efforts are on to appoint efficient officers in this significant post of the field administration ahead of the upcoming national polls. This time, there are plans to appoint some officials from the 28th BCS administration cadre as deputy commissioners (DC). Several officers from the 28th batch have already been interviewed. At present, officials from the 24th, 25th, and 27th BCS batches are serving as DCs. Among them, officers from the 24th and 25th BCS joined the service during the BNP-led government (2001–06), while those from the 27th BCS entered the service during the caretaker government (2007–08) following the political changeover of 1/11. Multiple sources at the Ministry of Public Administration said there is a policy decision to withdraw officials from the 24th BCS who are now serving as deputy commissioners (DC) and appoint new ones in their place. At the same time, changes may also come in some other districts. The Ministry of Public Administration issued a notification today, Monday, appointing new deputy commissioners (DC) in six districts. Shahid Hossain Chowdhury, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, has been appointed DC of Patuakhali replacing Abu Hasnat Mohammad Arifin, who has been transferred as DC of Kushtia, while Kushtia DC Toufiqueur Rahman has been transferred as DC of Khulna. Sifat Mehnaz, DC of Meherpur, has been transferred as DC of Kurigram. Abdul Salam, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, has been appointed DC of Meherpur. Meanwhile, Abdullah Al Mahmud Zaman, zonal settlement officer of the Land Records and Survey Department, has been appointed DC of Netrakona.",

    "title": "Joint statement by 11 nations Intl. community to stand by Bangladesh in resolving the Rohingya crisis",
    "content": "In view of the complexities surrounding the Rohingya crisis, the international community has pledged to continue working with the Bangladesh government to maintain focus on the situation in Myanmar and the ongoing humanitarian emergency in Bangladesh. In particular, ahead of the upcoming high-level conference in New York next month, Bangladesh and the international community will work in close cooperation. Marking eight years since the mass influx of Rohingya from Myanmar’s Rakhine State into Bangladesh, eleven Western nations have reaffirmed their commitment to stand by Bangladesh. Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, Switzerland and Finland expressed this pledge in a joint statement. On Monday morning, the embassy of France in Dhaka released the joint statement through its official X handle and Facebook page. The statement by the 11 nations said, “Eight years on, we recall the actions of the Myanmar military which led to the displacement of a vast number of Rohingya people. Currently, over 1.1 million (11 lakh) Rohingya remain in Bangladesh, with new arrivals continuing to seek refuge in camps.” The statement further stated, “We commend the resilience and fortitude of the Rohingya, who have endured prolonged hardship and displacement. Their perseverance is especially notable in the face of the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Rakhine State.” The 11 nations statements declared, “We extend our deep appreciation to the interim Government of Bangladesh and to the Bangladeshi people for providing shelter, safety and lifesaving humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya, including those newly arrived.” The statement emphasised that Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh wish to return to their homeland. It reiterated that the international community remains committed to exploring viable pathways for repatriation. However, cross-border displacement continues and many Rohingya remain internally displaced within Rakhine. Presently, conditions in Myanmar do not allow for their voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return. In the joint statement, the 11 nations affirmed, “Addressing the root causes of displacement is essential, requiring a peaceful and stable Myanmar. Therefore, we acknowledge that it is not yet possible to set a definitive timeframe for Rohingya repatriation. We urgently call on all parties to take immediate steps towards creating a possible environment for return.” The 11 nations further stated, “We strongly condemn the violence and human rights violations committed by the Myanmar military and other armed groups. We once again call for an end to violence and for unimpeded humanitarian access. We also reiterate the demand for the release of those unjustly detained. We remain committed to supporting international efforts to ensure accountability for breaches of international humanitarian law and other grave violations of human rights.” The countries that gave joint statement declared, “We support more durable solutions for Rohingya refugees through strengthened self-reliance. In particular, as humanitarian funding for the crisis diminishes, we stress the importance of preparing them for eventual repatriation. We also reaffirm our support for the host communities in Cox’s Bazar, who have generously extended hospitality to the refugees.” The countries in the statement stated, “We underline the importance of ensuring meaningful participation and inclusive representation of the Rohingya, so that they are empowered in decision-making and able to lead safe, dignified and constructive lives while in Bangladesh. Eight years on, the international community stands steadfastly with the Rohingya and Bangladesh in seeking long-term and sustainable solutions. We remain committed to addressing the root causes of this crisis.”",

    "title": "Opinion What is India’s ‘game plan’ on Bangladesh?",
    "content": "Since the “Monsoon Uprising,” the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her entourage have been staying in India under its hospitality. Neither Hasina nor the Indian government has clarified under what legal status she is there — as a political refugee or under some special arrangement. What is clear, however, is that she is there, and living comfortably. An Indian online portal, The Print, has provided a detailed account of their stay, part of which was republished in Prothom Alo. According to that report, former state minister Mohammad Arafat said they are working day and night to figure out how Sheikh Hasina can be restored to power. He is not alone. About two thousand Awami League leaders and activists are living at home in India. Some are going to the gym, some are transplanting their hair, and some are joining online meetings. But Arafat, he says, has set aside all comforts and is devoting his time to one task, that is how to remove the Yunus government and reinstate Hasina. Their stay in India is not any “highly classified” secret. Hasina herself is issuing daily instructions over phone on what should be done and where. She occasionally assures that she will be returning home soon. Disturbed by this overt political activity of the former head of government, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry sent a formal letter to India requesting that it be stopped. As far as can be recalled, Chief Adviser Professor Yunus raised the same request in his only face-to-face meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi three months ago in Bangkok. Recently, India’s Ministry of External Affairs dismissed Bangladesh’s complaint in an official press statement. It said clearly: “No, we are not aware of any anti-Bangladesh political activity by Awami League members. The government of India does not tolerate such political activity. In other words, the allegation by the interim government is baseless.” That this Indian statement is a blatant falsehood hardly needs to be said. If a reporter from The Print can simply pick up the phone and learn directly “from the horse’s mouth” what is happening, it is unbelievable that India’s entire intelligence apparatus failed to detect the same. The Print’s report details exactly which Kolkata neighborhoods these Awami leaders are staying in, which apartments, alone or with roommates. Several YouTube videos have already circulated riveting stories about their lives there. The implication is obvious that the Indian government knows everything and has deliberately allowed Hasina and her followers to stay and operate there. By most accounts, Hasina has been given shelter as a state guest — meaning her food, phone bills, and security are all being paid for by India. Some Indian politicians have begun questioning why, knowing that this damages bilateral relations, India continues to treat Hasina with such indulgence. Asaduddin Owaisi, head of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, has asked why the Indian government deports ordinary people to Bangladesh just for speaking Bengali, yet treats Hasina with such honour. If Bangladeshis are to be expelled, he suggested, that should begin with Hasina herself. It has often been said that Hasina’s fall from power was a major diplomatic setback for India. Prime Minister Modi had invested heavily in Hasina, treating her as his own ally — and reaped significant benefits. An Awami League foreign minister once candidly admitted in India, “For India’s own interests, it must keep Hasina in power.” But India failed to learn the basic lesson about putting all its eggs in one basket. With Hasina’s downfall in the Monsoon Uprising, Modi lost all. Many have remarked that if India had invested in Bangladesh and its people, rather than solely in Hasina and the Awami League, it would not be in today’s predicament. Naturally, the question arises that why does India still keep Hasina and the Awami League in its pocket, instead of learning from this mistake? The simple answer is that to use later, if needed. Political scientists call this strategic leverage. In practical terms, it is a bargaining chip. As long as Hasina and the Awami League can be preserved as a “factor” in Bangladeshi politics, India can use them in negotiations with any future government in Dhaka — whether on trade, diplomacy, or other matters.The two countries are neighbours; they cannot wish each other away. Sooner or later, relations will have to be normalised. When that moment comes, India will place its “Hasina card” on the table. Such uses of strategic leverage are not new. For instance, Pakistan once sheltered Indian separatists in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, hoping to gain advantages. Today India supports Baloch rebels with money and weapons for similar reasons. There is an even graver possibility: India may genuinely believe that sooner or later Sheikh Hasina will return to power in Bangladesh. Hasina herself has said so — YouTube is witness.

    "title": "Analysis Rohingya crisis: Why does the resolution remain so complex?",
    "content": "In the present reality, the voluntary repatriation of the Rohingyas remains uncertain, while it has also become nearly impossible for Bangladesh alone to shoulder the responsibility of such a vast population. The Rohingya crisis is exerting long-term political and economic pressure on Bangladesh and is generating growing discontent among the local population. Umme Wara writes about the role of international powers and the associated complexities in the Rohingya crisis. Since the year 2022, the date 25 August has been observed every year in Bangladesh as ‘Rohingya Genocide Day.’ On this day in 2017, Myanmar’s armed forces launched indiscriminate attacks on the Rohingya religious and ethnic minority, killing people, committing rape, setting homes on fire and looting property. For years the Rohingyas had been victims of persecution and discrimination. The Myanmar government launched ‘Operation Clearance’ with the aim of wiping them out entirely. As a result, about 750,000 Rohingyas crossed into Bangladesh and took refuge. The United Nations and international courts have termed this brutal massacre, a ‘genocide.’ Yet this classification of the crime has not brought any qualitative change to the lives of the Rohingyas who have endured inhuman conditions in camps for eight years. Two notable reasons for this predicament are: a. The lack of legal recognition from the Bangladesh government as ‘refugees’; andb. The failure to take any effective international measures for resolving the Rohingya crisis, particularly due to the stance of powerful South Asian countries such as India and China regarding Myanmar’s accountability. There are certain political, legal, and diplomatic reasons behind the Bangladesh government’s decision not to grant the Rohingya population formal recognition as refugees. Bangladesh is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol. Therefore, under international law, the Bangladesh government had no legal obligation to grant refugee status to the Rohingyas who arrived in 2017. Instead, Bangladesh defined them as “Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals.” As a sovereign state, Bangladesh has allowed the Rohingyas to live not as refugees, but as temporary asylum-seekers. While this process has drawn humanitarian assistance from the international community, it does not oblige Bangladesh to provide them with permanent settlement. Furthermore, the then Bangladesh government believed that by not granting the Rohingyas refugee status, it was diplomatically sending a message to Myanmar that the Rohingyas’ permanent home lies in Myanmar. For that reason, Myanmar would have to take responsibility for their repatriation, even if delayed. By opening its borders and providing shelter to hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas in several phases, Bangladesh on the one hand set an example of fulfilling humanitarian responsibility. On the other hand, the long-term sheltering of such a vast displaced population has placed Bangladesh under economic and political pressure, due to increased population burden in Cox’s Bazar and Chattogram, environmental damage, economic strain, and a rise in criminal activities. The objective behind the decision not to recognise the Rohingyas as “refugees” has, to a large extent, failed due to various internal and international complexities. A notable reason for this is the absence of effective intervention from the two influential neighboring countries, India and China. Behind this lie several geopolitical, economic and strategic factors. China and India consider Myanmar an important partner in their efforts to expand influence in Southeast Asia. For China, Myanmar is one of the key corridors of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). On the other hand, India seeks to use Myanmar as part of its “Act East Policy.”China is one of Myanmar’s largest investors, with massive investments in ports, mines, gas and infrastructure. India, meanwhile, is involved in the Kaladan Multimodal Project and other road connectivity initiatives in Myanmar. Beyond these projects, both countries view Myanmar’s geographic location as strategically important for various reasons. Therefore, fearing potential harm to their respective interests if pressure were applied, China and India have prioritised their geopolitical and economic interests over humanitarian concerns in the Rohingya issue. It is not only India or China, but Russia's veto along with that of China at the UN Security Council that ensured that Myanmar escaped major international punishment. Even so, in December 2017 the then UN human rights chief indicated that Myanmar had carried out genocidal attacks against the Rohingya population and mentioned the need for preventive monitoring. In August 2018, the UN Human Rights Council’s fact-finding mission published its report, stating that the actions of Myanmar’s military against the Rohingyas demonstrated “genocidal intent.” The crimes identified included genocide, war crimes, and crimes ag",

    "title": "Nation is ready for polls: Chief adviser",
    "content": "Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus on Monday said that the nation is ready for the next general election as the country has come to a stable situation after a mass uprising mixed with the killing spree last year. “Now, we are ready for another transition in our political history . . . the country has come to this stable enough and ready to have the election. So, we announce the election in the first half of February 2026. The interim government will be replaced by an elected government,” he said. The chief adviser said this while addressing the ongoing three-day international conference titled \"Stakeholders' Dialogue: Takeaways to the High-Level Conference on Rohingya Situation\" at the Hotel Baywatch in the coastal district that hosts over a million Rohingyas. The conference aims to engage global stakeholders to find solutions to the prolonged Rohingya crisis. Professor Yunus today formally inaugurated the main session of the stakeholders' dialogue. Recalling the bloody events of last year, the Chief Adviser said, “One year back, we have gone through a killing spree. And followed by student uprising, a student-led uprising to free the country from the fascist regime.” About the Rohingya crisis, Professor Yunus also expressed hope that the ongoing transition would pave the way for resolving the crisis of the forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals. “It will be complete when we see we have also achieved this goal, to have all our Rohingya guests return to their own home in their own environment,” he added. In the conference, the head of the interim government placed a seven-point proposal to resolve the protracted Rohingya crisis and called upon the international community to take stronger action to ensure justice, repatriation and stability for the Rohingyas. High Representative for the Rohingya Issue and National Security Adviser of Bangladesh Khaliur Rahman delivered the welcome address while Disaster Management and Relief Adviser Faruk E Azam, Bir Protik, and Assistant High Commissioner, UNHCR Raouf Mazou spoke at the event. A wide spectrum of participants, including diplomats, international experts, Rohingya community representatives, global organizations and academics from both home and abroad and representatives from BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and National Citizen Party (NCP) attended the event, which will end tomorrow.",

    "title": "Rohingya demand justice for ‘genocide’, plead for repatriation",
    "content": "A number of programmes including street rallies, processions, and gatherings were held in the refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar on Monday, 25 August, to mark ‘Rohingya Genocide Day. A rally was organised at the football ground of Kutupalong Modhur Chhara refugee camp in Ukhiya upazila of the district in the morning with the participations of 25,000 to 30,000 Rohingyas. At the rally , Rohingyas pleaded for repatriation to Rakhine State in Myanmar, as well as demanded justice for the ‘genocide’ committed against the Rohingyas in Rakhine. On 25 August 2017, influx of Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh leaving their homes in the face of persecution by Myanmar’s armed forces. Since 2022, the Rohingya community has been observing 25 August every year as ‘Rohingya Genocide Day.’ To mark the day, human chains, street rallies, and processions were organised from 7:00am across at least 15 camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf of Cox’s Bazar. Around 9:30am, a rally was organided at the football ground of Madhur Chhara (camp-4) in Ukhiya. Rohingya men and women from different camps joined the gathering. Speakers at the rally sought cooperation and intervention from the United Nations and the international community for Rohingya repatriation. Since an international conference on the Rohingya issue was scheduled at a hotel in Inani beach of the district, the gathering ended hastily around 10:00am. Visiting the rally ground around 9:00am, Rohingya people were seen gathering, wearing headbands with various demands and holding placards. From time to time, processions joined in, bringing more people of different ages. Many participants carried photos of their relatives killed by the Myanmar military. The placards demanded justice against the head of Myanmar’s junta government. The rally began at 9:30am. Rohingya leader Mohammad Zubair said the Rohingyas are united in favour of repatriation. But the international community must think about how repatriation will be possible in the unstable situation of Rakhine. Action must be taken on this issue. If repatriation is done through agreements with the Myanmar government, the Rohingyas will face obstruction from the Arakan Army. Another Rohingya leader, Kamal Hossain, said the Rohingyas have not yet been able to forget the scenes of that genocide in Rakhine. That day, the military shot and killed thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children in front of everyone. Houses were burned down. Rohingya women were raped. Hundreds of Rohingyas, crippled by bullets, are now living inhuman lives in the camps. The Rohingyas expect that the ongoing genocide case in the international court will be concluded soon and the killers will be punished. At the rally, Rohingya leaders also said that Rohingyas want to return to their homeland, want security, and want their properties back. A stable situation in Rakhine is essential before repatriation can begin. Otherwise, the Rohingyas will repeatedly face the same crisis. Prayers were offered in remembrance of those killed in Rakhine. Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Md Mizanur Rahman said the programmes marking Genocide Day were held peacefully. The Rohingyas have demanded sustainable and dignified repatriation along with the completion of the judicial process ongoing at the ICJ and ICC. Currently, there are more than 1.4 million registered Rohingyas in 33 camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf. Among them, 124,000 arrived in the past 18 months. Besides the registered ones, many other Rohingyas remain unregistered. However, in the past eight years, not a single Rohingya has been repatriated to Myanmar.",

    "content": "Home adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury has said Gazipur Metropolitan Police (GMP) commissioner Md Nazmul Karim Khan would be served a show cause notice for blocking the roads while commuting to his workplace. The home adviser made these remarks at a press conference held at the home ministry after a meeting of the core committee on law and order on Monday. At the press conference, a reward was announced for the recovery of weapons and ammunition looted during the student-people's uprising. In response to a question regarding the GMP commissioner blocking roads to commute to his workplace the home adviser said the matter had come to their attention and that the police commissioner would be asked for an explanation. The home adviser said that they had discussed the matter of the GMP commissioner and that a decision had been made regarding him. He will be served with a show-cause notice and will be asked for an explanation as to why he blocks the road to get to his workplace. A report was published in Prothom Alo with the headline, 'Commissioner stays in Dhaka, roads closed for entry into Gazipur’, on Sunday. Another report was published online on Prothom Alo the day before, with the headline, 'Mugging-looting with stolen arms, no trace of 1363’, on Saturday. Announcing rewards for the recovery of looted weapons and ammunition, the home adviser said that Tk 50,000 would be given for a pistol or a shotgun, Tk 100,000 for a Chinese rifle, Tk 150,000 for an SMG, Tk 500,000 for an LMG, and Tk 500 would be given for each bullet. The home adviser also stated that anyone who provides information about the looted weapons will have their name and identity kept secret. He added that efforts would be made to recover as many of the looted weapons as possible before the election. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said that a lot of recruitment is taking place now and called for any information on recruitment corruption to be reported. The home adviser stated that all measures have been taken to stop recruitment corruption and that there have been no reports of such corruption in the last year. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said that since he took office, he has gained new friends and relatives. He urged people to report anyone who extorted money by claiming to be his friend or relative. He requested that the media publish news if any adviser engages in corruption but also asked them not to publish incorrect information. The home adviser said that efforts would be made to bring back the police officer accused in the Abu Sayeed murder case, who has been arrested in India, through Interpol as soon as possible. He added that there is a system for sending such requests through the proper channels between the BGB and BSF, and that this arrangement could also be used. The home adviser said that while mob violence has not been completely eradicated, it has decreased. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said that a fair election depends on the people and political parties. He added that if they become election-oriented, many problems will be reduced, and that the people have already become election-oriented. He concluded that the chief adviser has said the nation's hope is for a peaceful election in a festive atmosphere, and every effort will be made to fulfil that hope.",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly involv",

    "title": "Noab hikes newspaper price by Tk 2 from Jul 25",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Yet-to-start mega projects: Consider putting  them on hold",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The High Court yesterday came down hard on Bangladesh Railway for mismanagement, ticket scalping and carrying passengers on the train roofs. \"If any train carries passengers on its roof, appropriate actions will be taken against the officials concerned,\" said the court. The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Electricity crisis may worsen",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendations. I",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact.

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Parties can’t be forced to join nat’l polls: CEC",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280.

The total number of HC judges now stands at 113. The appointments, made under Article 98 of the Constitution and in consultation with Chief Justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, were confirmed in a notification issued by the law ministry. The new judges will serve for a term of two years from the date they take their oaths. The list of appointees includes senior judges of the lower judiciary, deputy attorneys general, and practising advocates of the Supreme Court. Among them are Chattogram District and Sessions Judge Md Nurul Islam, Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge Md Jakir Hossain, Supreme Court Registrar General Aziz Ahmed Bhuiyan, and Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission Secretary Murad A Mowla Sohel. Several prominent lawyers have also been elevated, including advocates Md Anowarul Islam Shaheen, Raziuddin Ahmed, Faysal Hasan Arif, Fatema Anwar, Abdur Rahman, Syed Hasan Zobair, Md Ashif Hassan, Md Ziaul Haque, and Urmee Rahman.

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public National Security Adviser and High Representative for the Rohingya Issue Khalilur Rahman today said the Stakeholders' Dialogue has once again reflected the Rohingyas' clear and unmistakable yearning to return to Myanmar. They want to return to their homeland with dignity and safety, with the restoration of their rights and accountability for atrocities committed against them, he said. To address the ongoing crisis, he said, he has been maintaining engagement with all key actors, including the Arakan Army and the Myanmar government. \"A solution cannot be achieved by leaving out any important actor. Negotiations must involve everyone in order to be effective. If one party is excluded, any agreement reached is likely to fail or collapse,\" he said, while addressing the concluding session of the international conference, \"Stakeholders' Dialogue: Takeaways to the High-Level Conference on Rohingya Situation\", held in Cox's Bazar. Khalil also underscored the historic participation of the Rohingya community at the dialogue, marking the first time they collectively presented their perspectives under one roof. \"The upcoming UN High-Level International Conference on the Rohingya issue will be held on September 30 at the UN Headquarters. In preparation, we organised this dialogue to hear the voice of the Rohingya directly. This was historic,\" Khalil said, noting that Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus opened the session with a seven-point proposal expected to shape discussions at the UN meeting. Khalil highlighted six major issues raised during the dialogue, including Rohingya aspirations for safe, dignified, and permanent return to Myanmar. He stressed that international aid is declining, which is threatening essential services such as food, healthcare, and education. Trust between parties, he said, remains essential for a sustainable solution, and the dialogue marked a significant step in fostering confidence among stakeholders. Khalil raised concerns over the criminal activities inside Myanmar that threaten regional stability. He also clarified that ICC processes are ongoing and do not require acceleration from Bangladesh. Bangladesh has submitted lists for approximately 800,000 Rohingya, with Myanmar confirming over 1,80,000 as eligible for return, and further verification is ongoing, he added. The dialogue also highlighted systematic persecution, and discriminatory laws such as the 1982 Citizenship Law as root causes of the crisis. Panelists cited ongoing human rights violations in Rakhine, including indiscriminate attacks, arson, mass killings, rapes, and forced conscription by both the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Arakan Army. Participants also expressed concern over the pressure on Bangladesh, particularly host communities and the environment in Cox's Bazar and Bhasan Char, while acknowledging Bangladesh's generosity. They called for proactive roles from neighbouring countries, ASEAN, the UN, and concerned partners. At the concluding session, Ismail Jabiullah, adviser to BNP chairperson, said the Rohingya crisis has placed a heavy economic and social burden on Bangladesh which must be resolved by Myanmar with active international involvement. \"I was the first camp-in-charge of Kutupalong camp in 1978 and worked alongside my Rohingya friends. The problem originated in Myanmar and has to be settled with their initiative,\" he said. He welcomed the government's seven-point plan and regional engagement. Asaduzzaman Bhuiyan Fuad of AB Party drew parallels with refugee crises in Afghanistan and Syria, calling for pragmatic solutions, including the right to work and education, while preparing for repatriation. Mia Golam Porwar, secretary general of Jamaat-e-Islami, said, \"Jamaat will remain firm in supporting humanitarian assistance, justice, and a sustainable solution for the Rohingya crisis.\" Akhter Hossen of the National Citizen Party expressed solidarity, saying, \"We want justice for the Rohingyas. They must be given food, education, and basic rights until their safe return to Myanmar is ensured.\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

The other accused are then DMP (Khilgaon zone) additional deputy commissioner Rashedul Islam, then Rampura Police Station officer-in-charge Mashiur Rahman, then sub-inspector of Rampura Police Station Tariqul Islam Bhuiyan, and then Rampura police outpost assistant sub-inspector Chanchal Chandra Sarkar. The five former police officials are facing charges in the case filed over the killing of two people and the shooting of two others during police action in Rampura. Of them, only ASI Chanchal Chandra Sarkar is currently in custody. On July 19, six-year-old Musa was shot and critically injured during a police crackdown. The same bullet passed through the child's body and fatally struck his grandmother, Ayesha Begum. Musa survived after treatment, but his grandmother died. On the same day, another victim, Md Nadim, was shot dead in Rampura. In a separate incident, a video that went viral on social media showed 18-year-old Amir Hossain clinging to the ledge of an under-construction building while policemen appeared to fire at him at close range. The footage drew widespread outrage as Amir was seen desperately trying to save himself before being shot. In a related development, ICT also ordered jail authorities to produce former additional deputy commissioner Sachin Moulik on August 28 in connection with the killing of Golam Nafiz, who was shot dead at Farmgate during the uprising. Moulik is already in custody in another case. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

Both India and Bangladesh have been informed about it and the case is under joint scrutiny,\" said a senior West Bengal police officer. Arifuzzaman had been in hiding since the student-led mass movement in July-August last year toppled the Awami League government and ousted Sheikh Hasina on August 5. He had entered India soon after the fall of the AL government and had been staying with relatives in West Bengal's Tentulia for several months before returning to Bangladesh, according to several India media reports. He was caught last Saturday while trying to re-enter India. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Myanmar solely responsible for creating favourable conditions for Rohingyas’ return: UN",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public The United Nations has said that Myanmar bears full responsibility for creating conditions that allow Rohingya refugees to return home voluntarily, safely, and with dignity. Marking the eighth anniversary of the Rohingya exodus into Bangladesh, the UN and 11 Western countries issued statements urging action to address the crisis, which has displaced more than a million people since 2017. On August 25, 2017, Myanmar's military launched a campaign of genocidal violence against the Rohingyas in Rakhine State. Thousands were killed, while survivors endured mass arson, rape, torture, and ethnic cleansing. About 750,000 people fled into Bangladesh, joining those displaced by earlier pogroms. Since late 2023, another 200,000 Rohingyas have crossed the border, swelling their population in Cox's Bazar to over one million. In a statement issued from Cox's Bazar, Raouf Mazou, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, stressed that humanitarian aid alone cannot resolve the crisis. The safe and dignified voluntary return of Rohingyas remains the most desirable solution, and the responsibility to create such conditions lies squarely on Myanmar, Mazou said. He urged dialogue with all parties as a first step, insisting that human rights be respected and civilians protected. \"A situation involving over one million displaced persons cannot be left to morph into a regional crisis affecting all countries in the region,\" he said. In a joint statement issued in Dhaka, the embassies and high commissions of Canada, Australia, the UK, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Finland echoed the UN's call. They said Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh want to return to their homes but cannot do so under current conditions. \"These conditions can only be met by addressing the root causes of their displacement, which requires a peaceful and stable Myanmar. We therefore recognise that a timeline for the return of the Rohingya cannot yet be established,\" the statement said. The envoys condemned escalating violence and human rights abuses by Myanmar's military regime and other armed groups, calling for an immediate end to all acts of violence and for unrestricted humanitarian access. They also pledged continued support for both the Rohingya and the Bangladeshi host communities in Cox's Bazar. The statement further noted that the international community would maintain pressure on Myanmar at upcoming platforms, including the High-Level Conference on the Rohingya crisis in September 2025. Members of the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M), an independent group of international experts, urged global powers to hold the Myanmar military accountable. \"The architects and perpetrators of the Rohingya genocide -- the Myanmar military -- continue to act with total impunity,\" said Marzuki Darusman of SAC-M. Chris Sidoti, also of SAC-M, added: \"The most meaningful contribution the international community can make for the Rohingya is to bring Min Aung Hlaing and other military leaders before an international court.\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Tom Andrew, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, today highlighted concrete international efforts to curb weapons flow to Myanmar's military as a step toward facilitating the repatriation of Rohingya refugees. He cited Singapore's investigation into the transfer of military materials, which reduced weapons imports to Myanmar's military by nearly one-third by the rest of the world, demonstrating that coordinated action by member states can produce tangible results. Speaking at an international conference titled, \"Stakeholders' Dialogue: Takeaways to the High-Level Conference on Rohingya Situation\", in Cox's Bazar, Andrew stressed that while the UN provides a vital platform to lay out facts and truths, the success of interventions depends on the political will and engagement of member states. \"While a global arms embargo by the UN Security Council may not be immediately achievable, member states can act independently when they receive verified information,\" he said. Andrew described how his report revealed that hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of weapons materials were being funnelled through Singapore to Myanmar's military. Singapore launched an investigation, supported by the UN rapporteur, leading to a 90 percent reduction in such exports. He said that similar actions by other nations collectively resulted in a one-third reduction in weapons reaching Myanmar's military. He also expressed his gratitude to the Rohingya community for their resilience and active advocacy, particularly recognising community leaders for their persistent efforts to uphold human rights, dignity, and quality of life. Andrew praised Bangladesh for providing refuge to Rohingya refugees during the 2017 crisis, stating that the country's swift humanitarian response likely saved countless lives. \"The crisis facing the Rohingya is an invisible crisis within an invisible crisis,\" he said, urging targeted visibility to engage those who can influence change and contribute to solutions. Highlighting the conditions for successful repatriation, he emphasised that refugees must have access to healthcare, nutrition, education, and vocational skills to ensure sustainable livelihoods upon return. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

The minister said during the recent visit of Bangladesh's interim government Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus, there was no agreement signed that bound Malaysia to accept 10,000 Bangladeshi students to work in the country. He also advised Kedah industry and investment, higher education, science, technology and innovation committee chairman Dr Haim Hilman Abdullah to be more careful in making any statements on any issue, including those related to higher education. \"Based solely on a newspaper report in Bangladesh, he has made the allegation that I have agreed to consider providing 'graduate passes' to 10,000 Bangladeshi students in Malaysia to enable them to work here. \"The allegation is completely untrue and inaccurate,\" he said in a statement on August 23. Zambry said Haim Hilman's statement claiming that the people were worried because Malaysia had agreed to this matter was very irresponsible. \"The culture of producing 'content' to be made viral on social media with incorrect facts must be stopped immediately,\" the Malaysian minister said. Previously, Haim Hilman, through a two-minute and 19-second video uploaded on his TikTok, claimed that 10,000 Bangladeshi students would be given job opportunities in Malaysia.

India's high commission in Islamabad shared the warning on Sunday, the source said, following heavy rains in the Jammu and Kashmir region bordering Pakistan. India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The source declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. India put the Indus treaty in \"abeyance\" in April after linking a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir to Pakistan. The tensions escalated in May to the worst military clash between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades. Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards from India were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. Pakistan fears India could choke its main water supply, putting at risk most of its agriculture and hydro-power. Floods in Jammu and Kashmir killed at least 60 people this month. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

According to media watchdogs, around 200 journalists have been killed in nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas. In a statement, the Israeli military said its troops on Monday \"carried out a strike in the area of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis.\" \"The Chief of the General Staff instructed to conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" it said, adding it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such\". The civil defence's Bassal said an Israeli explosive drone targeted a building at Nasser Hospital, followed by an air strike as the wounded were being evacuated. A spokesperson for Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera on Monday said one of its photojournalists and cameramen, Mohammad Salama, was killed in the attack. \"Al Jazeera Media Network condemns, in the strongest possible terms, this horrific crime committed by the Israeli occupation forces, who have directly targeted and assassinated journalists as part of a systematic campaign to silence the truth,\" the broadcaster said in a statement. The Associated Press said in a statement that it was \"shocked and saddened\" to learn of the death of Mariam Dagga, 33, a visual journalist who had freelanced for the agency since the start of the war. In an earlier statement, it said Dagga had not been on an assignment with the agency when she was killed. A spokesperson for Reuters said: \"We are devastated to learn of the death of Reuters contractor Hussam al-Masri and injuries to another of our contractors, Hatem Khaled, in Israeli strikes on the Nasser hospital in Gaza today.\" \"We are urgently seeking more information and have asked authorities in Gaza and Israel to help us get urgent medical assistance for Hatem,\" the spokesperson added in a statement. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate also named two other victims as Moaz Abu Taha and Ahmad Abu Aziz. According to AFP journalists, Abu Taha had worked with some Palestinian and international outlets. Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military. AFP footage from the immediate aftermath of the attack showed smoke filling the air and debris from the blast on the floor outside the hospital. Palestinians rushed to help the victims, carrying bloodied bodies and severed body parts into the medical complex. One body could be seen dangling from the top floor of the targeted building as a man screamed below. A woman wearing medical scrubs and a white coat was among the injured, carried into the hospital on a stretcher with a heavily bandaged leg and blood all over her clothes. Nasser Hospital is one of the last remaining health facilities in the Gaza Strip that is at least partially functioning. Before the latest killings, media advocacy groups the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders said around 200 journalists had been killed in the Gaza war. Earlier this month, four Al Jazeera staff and two freelancers were killed in an Israeli air strike outside Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, prompting widespread condemnation. The Israeli military alleged that Anas al-Sharif -- a prominent Al Jazeera correspondent killed in the strike -- headed a Hamas \"terrorist cell\" and was \"responsible for advancing rocket attacks\" against Israelis. The CPJ slammed that strike, saying journalists should never be targeted in war. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Israel's offensive has killed at least 62,744 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

She also pointed to several other reasons -- loss of river navigability, climate change, and development projects along the riverbanks near hilsa sanctuaries. The adviser was speaking to the reporters after attending a workshop on buffalo grazing at Barishal Club this morning. She said, \"The government is taking strict measures including special drives to curb illegal fishing as well as to ensure jatka protection and uninterrupted breeding seasons.\" \"We are conducting drives, and hopefully hilsa production will increase and prices will come down in the coming days,\" she said adding that the government is also planning to regulate the chain of middlemen between rivers and retail markets. At the workshop, speakers said that buffalo grazing areas in coastal regions are shrinking rapidly due to climate change, land grabbing, and unregulated agricultural expansion, putting buffalo farming at risk. They recommended that the government adopt a clear policy, ensure long-term grazing land management, and involve local communities in the process to unlock new economic prospects for the buffalo sector. Grameen Jono Unnayan Sangstha (GJUS), Bangladesh Buffalo Association, and Coastal Vet Society Bangladesh jointly organised the workshop. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

Craig Ervine will lead a 16-member squad for the home matches to be held on August 29 and 31 at the Harare Sports Club. The squad also includes four players who did not feature in Zimbabwe's ODI series against Ireland - Clive Madande, Tony Munyonga, Brad Evans and an uncapped seamer Ernest Masuku. Zimbabwe ODI squad: Craig Ervine (Captain), Brian Bennett, Johnathan Campbell, Ben Curran, Brad Evans, Trevor Gwandu, Wessly Madhevere, Clive Madande, Ernest Masuku, Tony Munyonga, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava, Newman Nyamhuri, Sikandar Raza, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams. Zimbabwe Convener of Selectors David Mutendera believes Taylor's presence in the squad will lift the dressing room. \"We are delighted to welcome Brendan back into the fold,\" he said. \"His experience and quality are invaluable, especially in pressure situations, and his presence will no doubt lift the dressing room. \"This squad has been selected to give us the best chance against a strong Sri Lankan side. \"We have combined proven match-winners with players who are hungry to make their mark, and that mix of experience and energy will be crucial as we transition from red-ball cricket to the fast pace of ODIs.\" Both the captain Ervine and the head coach Justin Sammons felt that the adjustment from red-ball cricket to the ODIs is going to be a test. Sammons said, \"We've just come off a tough red-ball series and now it's about adjusting to the tempo and intensity of one-day cricket. Sri Lanka are a strong white-ball side and will punish any lapses, so we need to be sharp from ball one.\" \"Switching from red-ball to white-ball cricket is always a test, especially against a team of Sri Lanka's calibre. We need to stay flexible, back our plans and make the most of our home conditions to compete strongly in both matches,\" skipper Ervine added, while mirroring the coach's thoughts. Zimbabwe played their last ODI in February, having played seven Tests post that. The ODI series will be followed by a three-match T20I tournament in early September. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

England international Mainoo has yet to feature for United this season, missing both the opening-day defeat by Arsenal and Sunday's 1-1 draw at Fulham. The 20-year-old was overlooked by Amorim at Craven Cottage as United chased victory after Fulham's Emile Smith Rowe cancelled out the Rodrigo Muniz own-goal which had given the visitors the lead. When Amorim replaced Casemiro with new striker Benjamin Sesko, he moved Mason Mount, who started up front, back into midfield. Portuguese boss Amorim then replaced Mount with Manuel Ugarte before turning to defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in search of a winner. Fernandes blazed a first-half penalty over the crossbar but his place as a first-team regular remains assured, with a League Cup appearance against Grimsby on Wednesday seemingly the best Mainoo can hope for in the short term. \"He is fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" said Amorim. \"I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal. \"And then when I changed it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder. \"So he just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training.

Gomez, who was last the head coach of Argentine second division club CA Talleres, has a rich coaching profile, having worked as an assistant coach for Italian giants Inter Milan and Spanish top-flight club Valencia, head coach of Mallorca and won the AFC Cup with Malaysian outfits Johor Darul Ta'zim in 2015. Kings president Imrul Hassan confirmed the news to local media. The 68-year-old is expected to land in Dhaka next week and sign the contract. Earlier in July, Kings had announced that Brazil's Sergio Farias would be their next head coach, replacing Oscar Bruzon. He was supposed to join the club before their AFC Challenge League playoff tie against Syria's Al-Karamah on August 12 in Doha. But at the eleventh hour, the Brazilian joined Iraq's Duhok FC.

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Indian cricket is looking for a new main sponsor after a fantasy sports gaming platform pulled out of a deal worth $43.6 million following a government ban on online gambling, reports said Monday. Dream11, the biggest online gaming platform in the country, became the lead sponsor of the men's and women's national teams after signing a three-year deal in July 2023. The Dream11 logo is printed on the jerseys of the Indian players. It is also the sponsor of several Indian Premier League franchises. Last week, the Indian parliament passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, criminalising the offering and financing of such games, with offenders facing up to five years in prison. The Indian Express newspaper said Monday that representatives of Dream11 visited the office of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and informed its chief executive, Hemang Amin, that they won't be able to continue. \"As a result, they won't be the team's sponsors for the Asia Cup. The BCCI will float a new tender soon,\" the daily said, quoting a BCCI official. The T20 Asia Cup starts on September 9 in the United Arab Emirates. \"There's not much time left for the Asia Cup, but we are exploring options,\" a board official was quoted as saying by Sportstar website. Dream11 is also the official partner of the Caribbean Premier League and sponsors Australia's Big Bash League. The gaming ban impacts platforms for card games, poker and fantasy sports, including India's wildly popular homegrown fantasy cricket apps. The government said the rapid spread of gambling platforms had caused widespread financial distress, addiction and even suicide among the youth. It also said it was linked to fraud, money laundering and terrorism financing. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

In football, decisions are made with the team in mind; you have to understand things, and that was the case today,\" Alonso said after the match. \"The substitutions from game to game depend on what we need in terms of workload and opponent. I haven't made any decisions for next month. It's important for people to feel important, ready, and ready for the next game. It's important to maintain a stable performance as a team.

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public By day Shi Ming heals patients as a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. By night she trains to deliver brutal knockouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Shi shot to fame in November when she won a contract with UFC with a devastating kick that saw Chinese compatriot Feng Xiaocan carried out of the octagon on a stretcher. There was no trace of that ferocity in the demure, softly spoken figure AFP met last week ahead of her UFC debut. Dressed in baby pink with large round glasses resting gently on her nose, Shi said she has to \"brainwash\" herself before each fight to overcome her instinct not to cause harm. \"I do hold back a little,\" the 30-year-old said. \"In several past matches I didn't finish someone off when I had the chance, which allowed my opponents to recover and nearly reverse the outcome.\" \"I need to adjust myself for every match, not overthinking things. Before each competition I always brainwash myself to stay focused on the match,\" she added. The ruthless victory over Feng in Macau propelled her into the mixed martial arts (MMA) spotlight, in the process also revealing her other life to her parents, who had been unaware she was involved in the sport at all. On Friday thousands of Chinese fans packed a Shanghai arena to rally behind her, cheering loudly every time she landed a strike. Shi ultimately lost by decision, but still received a huge ovation, with fans screaming \"Go Dr Shi!\" as she bowed gratefully. - 'Under pressure' - The diminutive fighter still works full-time in her home city of Kunming, in southwest Yunnan province. \"I still prioritise my medical work and only focus on training after I finish all my duties,\" she said. Her days typically begin at the hospital, where she consults patients, prescribes medicine and performs acupuncture. Once work is finished, she spends hours training at a wrestling club alongside amateurs from all walks of life. As a child she practised taekwondo and the Chinese fighting system sanda, only starting MMA as a young adult. Physically, Shi does not fit the image of a professional fighter. She describes herself as near-sighted, without a long reach and short -- her opponent on Friday, Bruna Brasil, was four inches taller than her. \"People used to assume I would lose,\" she said. \"I'm under a lot of pressure these days. I feel like if I lose now, I might disappoint a lot of people.\" Despite still not fully understanding the sport and worrying about injury her parents support her unconditionally. In a recent UFC interview, her mother tearfully recalled Shi's teenage training years. \"It hasn't been easy for her to persist until now,\" she said. \"I'm incredibly proud and comforted by how far she's come.\" - Dual paths - Shi told AFP she would not be giving up her day job anytime soon. The reliable income allows her to fund her MMA training and coaching. \"I never put all my eggs in one basket,\" she said. \"I find joy in both practising medicine and fighting.\" Healing runs in her family -- both her grandparents were doctors -- and she often treats her own fight injuries with acupuncture. \"When I was young... I helped in (my grandparents') clinic every holiday and I wanted to be a doctor from then on,\" she said. \"I think it's a job that is very respected and can help my friends and family.\" But she said she might consider focusing more on MMA if she climbs up the UFC rankings. After her loss on Friday she said she felt she had \"let the whole of China down\". But fans on social media were undeterred. \"Dr Shi squeezes in training between giving injections. Reaching this level as a part-timer is already top-tier,\" read one comment. \"She's only going to get stronger!\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Jonathan David made a goalscoring start to his Serie A career on Sunday, netting the opening goal in Juventus' straightforward 2-0 win over Parma. Canada striker David guided home from Kenan Yildiz's low cross in the 59th minute to send Juve on their way to three points at the Allianz Stadium in Turin. \"It was everything I hoped for... I'm happy to score in my first game. But the most important thing is the three points,\" said David to DAZN. \"The target is to help the team as much as I can. If it's by scoring goals or getting assists or running back and defending, I will do everything.\" The 25-year-old was brought in as a free agent to help boost an attack which had for too long been let down by misfiring Dusan Vlahovic, and David showcased the goalscoring instincts which made him a hero at Lille. But it was Vlahovic, who is reportedly on the transfer list at Juve, who made sure of the win near the end of an uninspiring contest when he tapped home another Yildiz pass from close range with six minutes remaining. Vlahovic netted moments after Andrea Cambiaso was given a straight red card for lashing out at Mathias Lovik after battling for the ball with the Norwegian defender. Juve were also boosted by the solid return of key defender Gleison Bremer who missed most of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. - Scamacca back for Atalanta - Another player struck down by an ACL injury last term, Gianluca Scamacca scored his first goal in over a year as Atalanta drew 1-1 with promoted Pisa in their first league fixture under new coach Ivan Juric. Scamacca hadn't scored since May 2024 before he classily fired home the leveller for Atalanta in the 50th minute, ending a nightmare which started this time last year with the knee ligament tear. The 26-year-old's strike cancelled out Isak Hien's own-goal which gave Pisa a shock lead midway through the first half. \"A lot of time has passed but I worked this hard so I could have moments like this... It's a shame that we only managed to draw but it was a good performance,\" said Scamacca. \"I always try to give my best, to help my teammates and be the best version of myself. I don't know if it's going to be my year but the important thing is that it's Atalanta's year.\" Scamacca, who thumped the crossbar with a towering header shortly after scoring, was one of the heroes of Atalanta's historic Europa League triumph which ended up being the crowning glory of previous coach Gian Piero Gasperini's long reign in Bergamo. And fans loudly cheered the Italy striker when he was replaced by Nikola Krstovic in the 72nd minute, with his excellent performance a huge plus for Atalanta following the big-money departure of Mateo Retegui for Saudi Arabia this summer. - Como's fast start - Earlier, Como hinted at another strong season in Serie A after seeing off Lazio 2-0 with a performance typical of a club on the rise under Cesc Fabregas. Goals in each half from Tasos Douvikas and starlet Nico Paz, the latter a stunning free-kick in the 73rd minute, were enough for Como to take all three points at the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia. Como finished 10th last season after reaching the top flight for the first time in over two decades and the ambitious lakeside club invested heavily in the summer. Financial backing from tobacco giant Djarum means Como will be a force to be reckoned with this term, and they would have won by a bigger margin had Mergim Vojvoda's powerful strike not smashed off the crossbar four minutes after Paz's strike. Lazio are under a transfer ban until January for not respecting Serie A's financial requirements and were second best all evening. Sebastiano Luperto's thumping header salvaged a point for Cagliari in the fourth minute of stoppage time to give the the Sardinian outfit a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim believes his side need to show more maturity after blowing the lead to draw 1-1 at Fulham on Sunday and remain without a win this season. The Red Devils were made to pay for not making more of a dominant first 45 minutes, during which Bruno Fernandes blazed a penalty over the bar. Amorim, though, was more concerned by what he saw after United took the lead thanks to Rodrigo Muniz's own goal on the hour mark. Fulham hit back to level through Emile Smith Rowe 17 minutes from time and ended the game on top. \"I think we scored the goal and then we forgot about how we play,\" said Amorim, who has won just seven of his 29 Premier League games in charge. \"We want to win so badly, and that is a good feeling, that we scored a goal and everyone on the pitch was thinking, 'Let's hold onto the advantage and try to win the game'. For me that is the moment that we have to enjoy more and push the opponent. \"We have to grow up a lot as a team. For me the most important thing is that during the week they were working really hard, today we worked really hard, and we are going to improve. The moment that changed the game was our goal.\" United captain Fernandes is normally a clinical penalty taker and Amorim said his Portutguese compatiot let the 38th minute miss affect him for the rest of the game. \"You have to put that in the past during the game,\" added Amorim. \"He is our leader and he has so much responsibility. I felt that he missed the penalty and he was thinking about it during the game. We need to move forward and to play the game.\" Fulham were left furious at two major decisions that went in United's favour. The visitors' penalty came after a VAR intervention when Calvin Bassey and Mason Mount were grappling from a corner. Yet, when Bassey appeared to be pushed by Leny Yoro in the move that led to United's goal, the video assistant officials did not get involved. \"I cannot understand. I would like to explain everything to you from the first whistle until the last but it is not my job,\" said Fulham boss Marco Silva. \"I don't want to go in this direction. Everybody in the world saw what happened this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\" রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Aryna Sabalenka launched the defence of her US Open crown with a battling victory on Sunday as American men's hopes Taylor Fritz and Blake Shelton advanced safely. World number one Sabalenka, who is bidding to become the first woman to win back-to-back US Open titles since Serena Williams completed a hat-trick of wins in 2014, was made to work hard en route to a 7-5, 6-1 victory over Switzerland's Rebeka Masarova. Masarova, ranked 108th in the world, pushed Sabalenka out of her comfort zone with a gutsy performance on the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center's main Arthur Ashe Stadium showcourt. Sabalenka will face unseeded Russian Polina Kudermetova in the second round. In other early action on Sunday, Kudermetova's sister Veronika was on the wrong end of one of the few early upsets, losing in three sets to Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen. Kudermetova, the 24th seed, was bundled out after a composed performance from the 23-year-old Tjen, the first Indonesian to play in the main draw of a Grand Slam singles event for 21 years. Tjen won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, and will now face Britain's former US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the second round. Raducanu, who made history at Flushing Meadows in 2021 by becoming the first qualifier ever to win a Grand Slam title, clinched her first US Open match win since that memorable triumph with a 6-1, 6-2 drubbing of Japan's Ena Shibahara. \"I wanted to win a match here really bad,\" said Raducanu. \"It's been four years, and it's a very special tournament for me.\" Denmark's 14th-seeded Clara Tauson was the highest-ranked player to fall in early action, tumbling out in three sets to Alexandra Eala of the Philippines, who won a nailbiting tussle 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (13/11). While Sabalenka was the highest-ranked women's player in action on Sunday, the men's tournament saw American fourth and sixth seeds Fritz and Shelton ease into the second round. Fourth seed Fritz, last year's beaten finalist and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last month, sailed through with a 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 defeat of unseeded compatriot Emilio Nava. Shelton progressed with a similarly comfortable 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 defeat of Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse. Shelton and Fritz are spearheading US hopes of a first Grand Slam men's singles win since Andy Roddick's victory at the 2003 US Open. Shelton though insists he is not looking beyond the second round, where he will face either Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz. \"As soon as you start looking ahead you stumble over your own feet. So just one game at a time,\" he said. Later Sunday, Novak Djokovic launches his quest for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title in an evening match against Learner Tien. The 38-year-old Serbian seventh seed has not played since his defeat in the semi-finals at Wimbledon last month, and has cut back his schedule as he focuses on Grand Slam events. In other men's matches on Sunday, 13th-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev opens his campaign against France's Benjamin Bonzi. Elsewhere Sunday, Czech 16th seed Jakub Mensik edged Chile's Nicolas Jarry 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-4 while Spanish 18th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina breezed past Alexander Shevchenko of Kazakhstan 6-1, 6-1, 6-2. Italy's 32nd seed Luciano Darderi eliminated Australia's Rinky Hijikata 6-2, 6-1, 6-2. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "title": "Mbappe, Vinicius shine as Real Madrid beat Oviedo",
    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Kylian Mbappe scored a brace while Vinicius Jr scored one and provided an assist as Real Madrid beat promoted Real Oviedo 3-0 in LaLiga on Sunday. For Oviedo, returning to Spain's top flight after an absence of almost a quarter of a century, the arrival of the 15-time European champions was a gala occasion, and the Asturian fans made their presence heard. Star turns Mbappe and Vinicius made the difference in the north of Spain. Coach Xabi Alonso made a couple of notable changes to his starting line-up from Madrid's opening 1-0 win against Osasuna, dropping Vinicius and Trent Alexander-Arnold for Rodrygo Goes and club captain Dani Carvajal, returning from injury. But the dropped Vinicius responded by producing an assist and a goal in his half-hour cameo. Argentinian teenage sensation Franco Mastantuono made his full debut in another change for Los Blancos. The 18-year-old showed his explosive dribbling ability early on when he burst past two defenders into the Oviedo box before going down and looking appealingly at the uninterested referee. A rare foray forward by the hosts saw Leander Dendoncker run onto a throughball and try to catch Thibaut Courtois out with a chipped effort in the 23rd minute. The Belgian shotstopper beat a hasty retreat before easily plucking the ball from the sky. Madrid came close to forcing a breakthrough when Arda Guler drive from inside the box was excellently saved by goalkeeper Aaron Escandell. The Turkish international turned provider as he drilled a pass into Mbappe's feet on 37 minutes, which the Frenchman welcomed on the turn before firing across Escandell. The goal was met by furious protests from the home side after Madrid's Aurelien Tchouameni seemed to follow through strongly on Dendoncker when winning possession back for his side in the build-up. Madrid nearly doubled their lead five minutes into the second period when a defensive mix-up resulted in a clearance sliced straight into the hands of a grateful Escandell. Rodrygo and the lively Mastantuono made way for Vinicius and Brahim Diaz just after the hour. Diaz immediately created a gilt-edged chance for the galloping Fede Valverde when his cushioned pass found the Uruguayan inside the box, but Escandell produced a fingertip save to keep the score at 1-0. Kwasi Sibo came within inches of sending the home support wild when, out of nowhere, he struck the post for Oviedo with Courtois rooted to the spot on 81 minutes. That chance served to wake Madrid up. Vinicius won the ball  two minutes later and drove forward towards the box before slipping a disguised pass to Mbappe who slotted home first time. The Brazilian then scored in the 93rd minute, when Diaz found him in space and he slipped home a composed finish. Elsewhere, Villarreal hammered Girona 5-0 at home as new signing Tajon Buchanan netted a hattrick to open his LaLiga account. A second-consecutive defeat to start the season leaves Girona, who played Champions League football last season, bottom of the table with seven goals conceded and none scored. The home side raced into a 4-0 lead inside 30 minutes, with Nicolas Pepe and Rafa Marin scoring as Buchanan grabbed a brace. The Canadian then got his third four minutes after the hour to cap a scintillating performance by the Yellow Submarine. Real Sociedad fought back from being 2-0 down at half-time in the Basque country to earn a point against Espanyol. Pere Milla and Javi Puado gave the Catalans the lead, before Ander Barrenetxea and Orri Oskarsson hit back for Sociedad in eight second-half minutes. Ante Budimir's ninth-minute goal gave Osasuna a 1-0 win over 10-man Valencia. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Records tend to follow whenever Bangladesh's ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan takes the field. The 38-year-old added another milestone to his career, becoming the first cricketer to complete the double of 7000 runs and 500 wickets in T20 cricket. He achieved the landmark while playing for Antigua and Barbuda Falcons in their Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2025 fixture against St Kitts and Nevis Patriots on Sunday. Shakib, who entered the game just one wicket shy of the landmark, dismissed Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan with a return catch in the 15th over, becoming only the fifth bowler in T20 history to claim 500 wickets. He did not stop there and struck twice more in his next over, removing Kyle Mayers and Navin Bidaisee to finish the match with figures of 3-11 and taking his tally to 502 career wickets. Only four bowlers before him had crossed the 500 mark -- Rashid Khan (660), Dwayne Bravo (631), Sunil Narine (590) and Imran Tahir (554) -- but unlike them, Shakib stands apart for his pure all-round acumen. His tally of 7000-plus runs (7574) makes him the only cricketer to achieve such a double. Bravo came closest, retiring with 6970 runs and 631 wickets, while Andre Russell is inching toward the feat with 9361 runs and 487 wickets. Shakib's bowling effort helped restrict St Kitts and Nevis Patriots to 133 for 9, a target Antigua and Barbuda chased down in 19.4 overs with seven wickets in hand. As he so often does, Shakib also contributed with the bat, coming in at No. 4 and striking two sixes and a boundary in an 18-ball 25 before being stumped. To add the cherry on top, he was adjudged the player of the match. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",

    "content": "Pak FM claims 1971 issues settled twice; Dhaka disagrees Content creator Tawhid Afridi arrested in Barishal Delimitation of Constituencies: Brawl, protests mark EC hearing 18km of Dhaka Bypass Expressway opens to public Rinky Biswas capped a remarkable campaign at the 17th Summer Athletics Championships by setting a third consecutive national record on the final day today. The long-distance runner from Bangladesh Navy clinched her fourth gold medal of the meet with a record-breaking performance in the 10,000m run, clocking 39:14.73 at the National Stadium. Running barefoot for comfort, Rinky dominated the three-day competition, rewriting the record books in every long-distance event she entered. On the first two days, she set national records in the 5000m (18:20) and 3000m (10:27.6) events. She also claimed her maiden senior-level gold in the 1500m on the opening day, eventually winning the best female athlete of the championships. In total, seven national records were set during the meet, with three coming on the final day alone. Interestingly, Rinky was once on track to become a footballer. However, her endurance caught the eye of coach Dilip Chakrabarti, who introduced her to athletics at the Junior Championships in 2018. That same year, at just 11 years old, the girl from Narail broke the national record in the 1500m. Her exploits attracted the attention of Bangladesh Navy, who brought her in as a contractual runner. Since then, she has become one of the country's most dominant long-distance athletes. Though she has lost count of her gold medals over the past eight years, she vividly remembers when she set records in the 3000m (in 2019), 5000m (2021), and 10,000m (2022). \"With four golds in this championship, I think my medal tally has crossed 10,\" Rinky said after her latest triumph. \"But what makes this special is that I managed to break [all my] records in all three long-distance events in a single competition while also winning every race I entered.\" The Grade 11 student said her confidence stemmed from strong performances in training, where she had already broken national records. \"I was confident I could achieve something big this time. I believed in myself, and I'm happy to have done it. Now, I hope Bangladesh Navy rewards me with a permanent job,\" she said. Despite her success, Rinky believes she can go faster if given proper support. \"I think I can improve my timing, but I need better training facilities from the federation and Bangladesh Navy,\" she added. She also expressed frustration that long-distance events are often neglected in international competitions. \"The federation should consider sending long-distance runners to international meets. With proper training, diet, and facilities, we can also deliver good results,\" she said. Rinky added that her elder brother, Sourov Biswas, inspired by her, has joined Bangladesh Army as a long-distance runner and is expected to compete in national events soon. In the 200m events, Tareq Rahman and Sharifa Khatun emerged champions. Tareq won gold on his 200m debut, clocking 22.04 seconds after UK-based sprinter Imranur Rahman pulled out midway with a hamstring injury. His coach said Imranur will need two weeks to recover. Sharifa edged veteran Shirin Akhter by a whisker, taking gold in 25.24 seconds. Shirin, a 16-time fastest woman, clocked 25.27 to settle for silver – her second after losing the 100m crown to Sumiya Akhter on day one. Bangladesh Army topped the medal tally with 26 gold, 21 silver, and 15 bronze medals. Bangladesh Navy followed with 13 gold, 16 silver, and 12 bronze, while Bangladesh Police finished third with one gold and two bronze medals. রাজনৈতিক বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, বাংলাদেশের 'দ্বিতীয় সংসদ' হিসেবে অভিহিত এই নির্বাচন সুষ্ঠু হওয়ার ওপরেই নির্ভর করছে জাতীয় সংসদ নির্বাচনের ভবিষ্যৎ।",
