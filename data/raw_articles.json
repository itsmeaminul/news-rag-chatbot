    "content": "A 14-member working group has been formed to review the demands of individuals holding BSc and diploma degrees in the engineering profession. The group will be headed by housing and public works ministry secretary Nazrul Islam. This information was shared today, Thursday, by environmental adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan following a meeting held at the conference room of the public administration ministry at the Secretariat. Syeda Rizwana Hasan stated that the heads of the government agencies responsible for hiring engineers have been included in the working group. In response to the demands of engineering students, the government also formed an eight-member committee yesterday, Wednesday, headed by energy adviser Fouzul Kabir Khan. This committee held its first meeting today in the conference room of the public administration ministry at the secretariat. Following the meeting, committee member and adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan told reporters that the issue between BSc degree holders and diploma holders in the engineering profession is not new — it has been ongoing for a long time. In order to resolve it, discussions need to be held with all stakeholders. That’s why a 14-member working group has been formed. She noted that all government agencies involved in recruiting engineers are included in the working group. \"They will listen to both BSc degree holders and diploma holders,\" she said. \"After that, the opinions of those who are experienced and well-informed on the matter will be taken into account. Any legal aspects involved will also be reviewed. Based on this, the committee will submit its final report.\" Calling on the protesters not to cause public inconvenience, Syeda Rizwana Hasan urged them to submit their demands in writing to the head of the working group, the public works ministry secrectary. She added that if they wish, they can also discuss their concerns directly with the committee or sit with the working group. \"This issue will not be resolved overnight,\" she said. \"The committee has been given one month to present its recommendations.\" Committee head Fouzul Kabir Khan said that the main committee will sit with both the protesters and their guardians. The committee will also meet with government agencies that recruit engineers — particularly the Public Works Department, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), and the Power Development Board (PDB). When asked about the immediate solution, Fouzul Kabir Khan replied, “This is the solution. The protesters are welcome to meet with the working group at any time. The graduate engineers have a three-point demand, while the diploma holders have a seven-point demand. We need to listen to both sides and understand their perspectives. The issue must be resolved impartially.” He added that there are differences of opinion between the two groups, and the committee’s role is to build a bridge — to bring both sides together. In response to another question, Fouzul Kabir Khan said that the working group has already begun its work, and the first meeting will be held this Sunday. The government has formed an eight-member committee to evaluate the legitimacy of the professional demands made by BSc degree holders and diploma holders in the engineering profession and to formulate recommendations accordingly. The cabinet division issued a notification regarding the formation of the committee on Wednesday. In this committee, adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan has been appointed as the chair, and Kazi Muhammad Mozammel Haque, additional secretary (Coordination & Reforms) of the public administration, has been appointed as the member secretary. The notification, signed by additional secretary Md Humayun Kabir, states that the government has formed the committee “to assess the validity of the professional demands of BSc and diploma holders in the engineering profession and to prepare recommendations accordingly.” Other members of the committee include adviser Adilur Rahman Khan, Professor Chowdhury Rafiq-ul-Abar, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Engineer Mohammad Rezaul Islam (President of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh), Engineer M. Kabir Hossain (President of the Institution of Diploma Engineers, Bangladesh), and Engineer Tanvir Manzur (Chairman of the Board of Accreditation for Engineering and Technical Education). After the first meeting, Fouzul Kabir Khan stated that six out of the eight committee members were present. One member is currently abroad, and another could not attend due to illness. Graduate engineers are protesting with a three-point demand, while diploma holders are demonstrating with a seven-point demand. The key demands of the engineering students are: Recruitment for the 9th-grade assistant engineer position should be done only through examinations, with a minimum qualification of a BSc in Engineering. Diploma holders are currently eligible to apply for the 10th-grade position — BSc degree holders should also be allowed to apply for this posit",

During the visit, he paid courtesy calls on senior Chinese military and civilian officials, including the Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Ground Force, General Chen Hui, and discussed various issues of mutual bilateral interest, says a press release of ISPR. On 22 August 2025, upon his arrival at the PLA Headquarters, the Army Chief was accorded a Guard of Honour. Later, he held a courtesy meeting with General Chen Hui, during which they discussed strategic cooperation between the two countries, enhancing people-to-people ties, and assistance in the repatriation of forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals. The discussion also included potential Chinese support for the development of Bangladesh’s defence industry. On 23 August 2025, the Army Chief met with Mr. Chen Defang, President of China’s NORINCO Group. During the meeting, they discussed issues relevant to the interests of the Bangladesh Army, including the upgrading and maintenance of various NORINCO-supplied military equipment currently in use by the Bangladesh Army. Additionally, the Army Chief visited the PLA Academy of Armoured Forces at its Beijing campus, where he toured training facilities and military equipment research and production labs. It is worth noting that Bangladeshi army officers regularly receive technical training at this internationally recognised academy. During his visit, the Army Chief also toured various NORINCO Group factories and research centers in Beijing and Xiang, as well as facilities of China Aerospace Long-March International Co. Ltd and Aisheng UAV Factory, which are engaged in the production of advanced weapons and ammunition. It may be noted that the Army Chief departed for China on 20 August 2025 on an official visit.",

    "title": "Trump's doubling of tariffs hits India, damaging ties",
    "content": "Additional 25 per cent tariff imposed as punishment for India buying Russian oil. Tariffs of up to 50 per cent threaten Indian exporters and jobs. US President Donald Trump's doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50 per cent took effect as scheduled on Wednesday, delivering a serious blow to ties between two powerful democracies that had in recent decades become strategic partners. A punitive 25 per cent tariff, imposed due to India's purchases of Russian oil, was added to Trump's prior 25 per cent tariff on many imports from the South Asian nation. It takes total duties as high as 50 per cent  for goods as varied as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals - among the highest imposed by the US and roughly on par with Brazil and China. The new tariffs threaten thousands of small exporters and jobs in India, including in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, and are expected to hurt growth in the world's fastest-growing major economy. There was no indication of renewed talks between Washington and New Delhi on Wednesday, after five rounds of talks failed to yield a trade deal to cut US tariff rates to around 15 per cent - like the deals agreed by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. The discussions were marked by miscalculations and missed signals, officials on both sides say. India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But an Indian government source said New Delhi hoped the US would review the extra 25 per cent tariff, adding that the government plans steps to help cushion its impact. There was no Indian market reaction to the move on Wednesday as bourses were closed for a Hindu festival, but on Tuesday equity benchmarks logged their worst session in three months after a Washington notification confirmed the additional tariff. The Indian rupee also continued its losing streak for a fifth consecutive session on Tuesday, ending at its lowest level in three weeks. While the tariff disruption would be bruising, it may not be all gloom and doom for the world's fifth-largest economy if New Delhi can further reform its economy and become less protectionist as it seeks to resolve the crisis with Washington, analysts said. A US Customs and Border Protection notice to shippers, opens new tab provides a three-week exemption for Indian goods that were loaded onto a vessel and in transit to the US before the midnight deadline. Also exempted are steel, aluminum and derivative products, passenger vehicles, copper and other goods subject to separate tariffs of up to 50 per cent under the Section 232 national security trade law. Indian trade ministry officials say the average tariff on US imports is around 7.5 per cent, while the US Trade Representative's office has highlighted rates of up to 100 per cent on autos and an average applied tariff rate of 39 per cent on US farm goods. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said India must simply stop buying Russian oil to reduce US import taxes. \"It's real easy, that India can get 25 per cent off tomorrow if it stops buying Russian oil and helping to feed (Russia's) war machine,\" Navarro told Bloomberg Television. Washington says India's purchase of Russian oil helps fund Moscow's war in Ukraine and that New Delhi also profits from it. India has rejected the accusation as a double standard, pointing to US and European trade links with Russia. China remains a top buyer of Russian oil, but Trump has said he does not immediately need to consider similar extra tariffs on Chinese goods amid a delicate US-China trade truce. Commenting on the punishing levy, India's junior foreign minister Kirti Vardhan Singh told reporters: \"We are taking appropriate steps so that it does not harm our economy, and let me assure you that the strength of our economy will carry us through these times.\" \"Our concern is our energy security, and we will continue to purchase energy sources from whichever country benefits us.\" US-India two-way goods trade totaled USD 129 billion in 2024, with a USD 45.8 billion US trade deficit, according to US Census Bureau data. Exporter groups estimate the tariffs could affect nearly 55 per cent of India's USD 87 billion in merchandise exports to the US, while benefiting competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China. Rajeswari Sengupta, an economics professor at Mumbai's Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said allowing the rupee to \"depreciate is one way to provide indirect support to exporters\" and regain lost competitiveness. \"The government should adopt a more trade-oriented, less protectionist strategy to boost demand, which is already slackening,\" she said. Sustained tariffs at this rate could dent India's growing appeal as an alternative manufacturing hub to China for goods such as smartphones and electronics. \"Up to 2 million jobs are at risk in the near term,\" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at the Anand Rathi Group. But he noted th",

    "title": "Engineering Rights Movement announces new programmes, ‘Complete shutdown’ to continue",
    "content": "Engineers Rights Movement, a platform of the protesting engineering students, said their ongoing 'complete shutdown' at all public and private universities will continue until further announcement. Platform president Md Wali Ullah made the announcement at a press conference at the Institute of Engineers, Dhaka (IEB) on Thursday afternoon. At the briefing, they also provided a detailed account of the ongoing movement and their demands. During the conference, a video presentation highlighted the disparities between diploma and BSc engineering degree holders. It was pointed out that in many cases, government job positions are reserved solely for diploma holders, leaving BSc engineers without opportunities. This practice needs to be stopped. Wali Ullah said, “Our movement has been going on seeking realisation of three demands, and the massive incident that occurred yesterday, Wednesday needs to be addressed. Although we were given a commitment yesterday, we have seen no implementation today. Therefore, our programme will continue: until the next announcement, complete shutdown will remain in place on campuses across the country.” The protesters also announced departmental conferences this week and a national conference in the following week. They said such programmes were planned to avoid public inconvenience. They, however, would hold a procession today. The engineering students’ demands are as follows: recruitment to the 9th-grade assistant engineer position should be done only through examination and with a minimum qualification of BSc engineering; in the 10th-grade position, where only diploma holders are allowed to apply, higher degree holders should also be eligible; and only those who complete a BSc engineering degree should have the right to write ‘engineer’ after their name. BUET students held sit-in programmes at Shahbagh on Tuesday and Wednesday to press home these three demands. Yesterday, Wednesday, students blocked Shahbagh intersection around 11:00 am as part of a pre-announced programme. At one stage around 1:00pm, they tried to move toward the chief adviser’s residence at Jamuna. Police stopped them near the Intercontinental Hotel, using sound grenades, tear gas shells, and water cannons, also charged-baton on the protesters, injuring many students. After the police charged batons, students blocked Shahbagh intersection from 5:30 pm until 10:30 pm. Last night, they announced the complete shutdown of engineers at all engineering universities across the country.",

The demonstrators also burned the effigy of police officer Masud Alam who is the Deputy Commissioner of Ramna Division of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP). Earlier, the students brought out a procession from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) that paraded different intersections including Shaheed Minar, TSC, Doyel Chattar, Shikkha Bhaban, National Press Club, and High Court. As the procession of protesters were moving towards DMP headquarters, it was intercepted by police at Matsya Bhaban intersection. Barred, the students took position in the street. After around an hour, the protesters left the intersection around 7:30pm. They later took position in front of Engineer’s Institute, halting traffic to Shahbagh. Shahin Al Mohammad Tasrif, a student of BUET’s Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department said, they are demonstrating today to press home a two-point demand. “Firstly, the home adviser and DC Masud have to seek apology and the latter has to be removed. Secondly, the three-point demand of demonstrating engineering students has to be implemented and a gazette has to be issued in this end soon.” On Wednesday, police attacked demonstrators who were pressing for their three-point demands while they were marching to Jamuna, the residence of the Chief Adviser. Many students were injured as the police hurled stun grenades, tear sells and charged batons.",

    "title": "Bangladesh national cricket team to have year-long training under BCB plan",
    "content": "The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken the initiative to keep the cricketers in cricket throughout the year by providing them world class facilities in different venues of the country. Bangladesh now have three different teams for three formats of cricket but when some players remain busy for a particularly format, the other players had to spend idle times. Moreover, there are some players, who are on the verge of national selection but for them there was no facilities to work extensively on their technique and others. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) will provide all those facilities by running the Bangla Tigers camp throughout the year. Coach Sohel Islam was given the responsibility of the head of this camp. Basically, this camp will include the cricketers in the national pool. Whenever and wherever it is needed, all kinds of work, indoor-outdoor or technical-mental aspects, will be part of the Bangla Tigers' year-round programme. \"Bangla Tigers is the name of the project. Through this camp, we will work with the cricketers who are in the national pool, all the year round,” Sohel said, explaining the mode of work. “They practice separately for T20, ODI or Test. Sometimes in large groups, sometimes in small groups and sometimes one-on-one. There will be efforts to ensure that they can prepare throughout the year and are always ready,\" he said. Sohel drew the example of player like Shadman Islam, a Test opener who is not considered for other format. Since Bangladesh have been busy playing T20 and ODI cricket of late, Shadman faced a hardship to keep him fit. The national team will play Tests next November and until then Shadman would have no cricket. Mushfiqur Rahim has quit playing in two other formats except Tests. The same case is for the likes of Mominul Haque, Khaled Ahmed or Ebadot Hossain. Sohel said the Bangla Tigers camp will have all the answers. “Those players won’t have to worry now. Through the Bangla Tigers camp, they will be provided the practice facilities to keep them in cricket now,” Sohel said. \"These practices are very specific and individual. Who has a deficiency? If Sadman's defense is good, then he doesn't need to practice defense for a long time. He would have to work on specific areas,” he said. “We are working on areas where improvement is needed, where skills need to be modified, adjustments are needed. Now we are doing it indoors. Then we will play matches amongst us.” Considering the match situation, the practice with new ball or old balls will go on, Sohel said. “Each task will be charted. Specific goals are set for workload management. In short, the cricketers' practice and the coaches' work will be to reach the goal,” he added. Sohel said that the Bangla Tigers camp will give the players’ needs a top priority. ''When someone comes to practice, be it a batsman or a bowler, we try to help him reach his goal. It can be technical or it can also be mental,” he said, adding that if we feel that we need to touch it, we will do it. Again, if there is a need to improve the tactics then we can do it properly, Sohel informed. “These things are in the mind and that is how they are done. We practiced, we sweated, if there is no purpose, then progress will not be understood. We are working with these in mind.” “ We will do practice with the new ball and old ball –according to the match situation. The players need to know how to react in different situation in matches. The Bangla Tigers camp will teach players those things elaborately.”",

Moreover, there is no scope for the Bangladesh Army to be involved in such responsibilities in the future. This was stated in a press release issued yesterday, Wednesday, by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The Dhaka University authorities on Tuesday issued a press release stating that there would be a three-tier security arrangement in the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (DUCSU) and hall union elections. Members of the university’s BNCC and the proctorial team would be at the first tier, police at the second tier, and the army would be stationed as a “striking force” at seven entry points of the university at the third tier. That morning, the university authorities issued the press release following a meeting between the chief returning officer and the candidates of the DUCSU and hall union elections at the university’s Senate Bhaban. Regarding strengthening security on the campus, the release said that the police would carry out their duties under the instructions of the returning officers during the election. If necessary, the army would enter the campus. After voting, soldiers would cordon off the polling centres until the announcement of results. No one except authorised persons would be allowed to enter during vote counting. Now, ISPR issued a press release regarding the deployment of the army in the upcoming central student union elections at universities. It said that the Bangladesh Army had taken note of reports in various media and on social media about deployment of the army centering the upcoming elections. The release said the army received no directive from the government to carry out duties in these elections and there is no scope for involvement in such responsibilities in the future. Bangladesh Army believes that with the direct cooperation of the existing law enforcement agencies and under the overall supervision of the university administration, the upcoming central student union elections will be completed in a peaceful and festive environment. On behalf of the Bangladesh Army, best wishes were conveyed to all, it added.",

    "content": "The chief returning officer of Dhaka University Central Student Union (DUCSU) elections, Professor Mohammad Jasim Uddin, has clarified their stance regarding army deployment in the polls. He said that assistance from the army would be sought to protect election security, if needed. However, there is currently no reason for any security concern. Professor Jasim Uddin made these remarks while speaking to journalists at the Senate Building of the university in front of the returning office around 3:30 pm on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release, “No directive has been given by the government to the Bangladesh Army to take responsibility for these elections (DUCSU and hall unions), and there will be no scope for such involvement in the future.” Replying to a query on the army issue, chief returning officer Jasim Uddin said that army deployment has been considered in their planning. If required, they will request this assistance through the university administration. However, at present, there is no reason for any security concern. Returning officer Kazi Maruful Haque said that the proposal for army deployment arose from students’ demands for round-the-clock security. Their request to move polling centres out of residential halls has been implemented. Maruful Haque further said that a student would take about eight minutes to cast all their votes. Even with 100 per cent voter turnout, booths will be arranged proportionately so that everyone can cast vote. Everyone will be able to cast their vote. There will be no irregularities. There is no concern regarding the election at this moment. Professor Golam Rabbani, head of the Code of Conduct Taskforce, said that at present, there are no banners or festoons on the campus. All have been removed through the proctor’s office. Candidates are allowed to distribute handbills and leaflets, and they are doing so. He further said an allegation of code of conduct violation was received from the Faculty of Fine Arts. A committee has been formed to investigate, and a report will be submitted today. He added that no code of conduct violations have been reported throughout the day. There was an allegation of a candidate announcing their manifesto with music at the Student-Teacher Centre. The candidate was asked to provide an explanation. After receiving a response, the candidate was warned. If such incidents occur again, punitive measures will be taken, Golam Rabbani added.",

    "content": "The state of maternal and child healthcare in the Rangpur Division is worse than the national average. Many mothers in the char areas of Rangpur are themselves adolescents, making the situation particularly distressing. Certain remote areas remain extremely difficult to access for healthcare delivery. Without addressing Rangpur, achieving national progress will remain unattainable. Furthermore, healthcare is not solely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health; coordinated action from multiple ministries is essential. Collective efforts, along with skilled personnel, infrastructure and dedicated budgetary allocation, must give special consideration to Rangpur. These observations were made yesterday, Wednesday, at a roundtable discussion on ‘Maternal and Newborn health services in Rangpur: Current Status, challenges and things to be done’ held at the Directorate General of Health Services in Mohakhali, Dhaka. The discussion was organised under the ‘Jononi Project’ by ‘Save the Children Bangladesh’, with support from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and in partnership with Prothom Alo as media collaborator. At the outset, Ujjal Kumar Roy, Project Director of Jononi, presented a concept paper. He reported that the neonatal mortality rate in Rangpur stands at 30 per 1,000 live births, compared to the national figure of 20. The child mortality rate is 33 in Rangpur, while nationally it is 25. The maternal mortality rate nationally is 196 per 100,000 live births, whereas in Rangpur it is 223. Child marriage rates are also significantly higher. Nationally, 27 per cent of girls marry below the age of 18, but in Rangpur this rises to 63 per cent. Similarly, 63 per cent of women conceive before the age of 19 in Rangpur, compared with 24 per cent nationally. Births attended by midwife for 70 per cent nationally, while in Rangpur the figure is only 49 per cent. During the discussion, speakers expressed their views on these findings. S M Abdullah Al Murad, Line Director for Maternal, Neo-natal and Child Health at the Directorate General of Health Services, highlighted various government initiatives. He stressed that antenatal care is indispensable for ensuring the health of mothers and newborns. Pointing out the urgent need for action in Rangpur, he emphasised public awareness campaigns, particularly within schools, to address the prevalence of child marriage. Dewan Morshed Kamal, Divisional Director of Family Planning in Rangpur, shared his personal experiences from visiting char areas. He noted that the conditions of many young mothers were harrowing, a 15-year-old carrying a child, with one in her arms and another unborn. Despite attempts at raising awareness, he acknowledged that socio-economic pressures, administrative shortcomings and other barriers hinder prevention efforts. He further observed that there is a lack of connection between Union Health and Family Welfare Centres and Community Clinics, stressing the need for greater coordination. Sohel Habib, Line Director (NCRH) of the Directorate General of Family Planning, identified child marriage as one of the most significant obstacles to improving maternal and neonatal healthcare in Rangpur. He underlined that awareness campaigns must be conducted with administrative support, alongside strong inter-ministerial coordination. Dr Gausul Azim Chowdhury, Divisional Director of Health Services in Rangpur, stated that efforts are being made to increase institutional deliveries and improve antenatal services. He emphasised the need to ensure transport facilities, including ambulances for mothers and to build confidence among adolescents in order to prevent child marriage. Zainal Abedin, Line Director for Hospital Service Management at the Directorate General of Health Services, observed that despite numerous government programmes, questions remain regarding the availability of quality services. Large numbers of people seek care in government hospitals and health centres, necessitating adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower. He suggested the establishment of healthcare centres through public–private partnerships, where the government would provide human resource support and the private sector would contribute infrastructural investment. Saiful Islam Majumder, Senior Assistant Secretary of the Health Services Division under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, drew on his field experience, stressing the need for integrated action at district and Upazila levels by all relevant ministries. Dr Shams El Arifeen, Emeritus Scientist at icddr,b, highlighted the significant disparity between rich and poor care, describing systemic barriers as a key factor. He added that although many argue healthcare delivery is difficult in remote regions, the very recognition of this difficulty indicates the path to a solution, requiring collaboration with the relevant ministries and organisations. Public health specialist Ikhtiar Uddin Khondaker emphasised th",

    "title": "Gaza at 'breaking point', says UN food agency chief after visit",
    "content": "The head of the UN's World Food Programme warned Thursday that famine-hit Gaza is \"at breaking point\", appealing for the urgent revival of its network of 200 food distribution points. \"Enough is enough,\" the WFP's executive director Cindy McCain said after visiting the besieged Palestinian territory, where Israel is pressing operations in its offensive against Hamas. \"Gaza is at a breaking point. Desperation is soaring -- and I saw it firsthand,\" McCain said in a statement. Her comments come less than a week after the United Nations declared a famine in Gaza, blaming the \"systematic obstruction\" of humanitarian deliveries by Israel. McCain went to Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah, where she visited a nutrition clinic keeping children alive and met with displaced mothers who struggle daily to find scraps of food. \"I met starving children receiving treatment for severe malnutrition -- and I saw photos of when they were healthy. Today they are unrecognizable,\" McCain said. \"We must urgently be able to revive our vast and trusted network of 200 food distribution points across the Strip, community kitchens and bakeries. It is urgent that the right conditions are in place so we can reach the most vulnerable and save lives\", she said. McCain met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to press for a \"surge of food assistance to reach the most vulnerable\". She also met Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Mustafa in Ramallah, the WFP said. \"What we need is a ceasefire. My heart goes to the mothers in Gaza, as well as to the mothers of the Israeli hostages, whose children are currently starving,\" McCain said. Israel, which is preparing to conquer Gaza City, is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to end its almost two-year campaign. The UN declared a famine in the Gaza governorate last week, but Israel has dismissed the report as \"fabricated\". The Hamas attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 62,895 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The UN considers those figures reliable.",

    "title": "US visa: Student, journalist visa limits proposed at 4 years, 240 days",
    "content": "The Trump administration aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media, according to a proposed government regulation issued on Wednesday, part of a broader crackdown on legal immigration. President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January. The latest move would create new hurdles for international students, exchange workers and foreign journalists who would have to apply to extend their stay in the US rather than maintain a more flexible legal status. The proposed regulation would create a fixed time period for F visas for international students, J visas that allow visitors on cultural exchange programs to work in the US, and I visas for members of the media. Those visas are currently available for the duration of the program or U.S.-based employment. There were about 1.6 million international students on F visas in the US in 2024, according to US government data. The US granted visas to about 355,000 exchange visitors and 13,000 members of the media in fiscal year 2024, which began on 1 October 2023. The student and exchange visa periods would be no longer than four years, the proposed regulation said. The visa for journalists - which currently can last years - would be up to 240 days or, in the case of Chinese nationals, 90 days. The visa holders could apply for extensions, the proposal said. China's foreign ministry, asked about the proposed new rule for Chinese journalists on Thursday, said it opposed \"the discriminatory practices adopted by the U.S. against specific countries\". The Trump administration said in the proposed regulation that the change was needed to better \"monitor and oversee\" the visa holders while they were in the United States. The public will have 30 days to comment on the measure, which mirrors a proposal put forward in 2020 at the end of Trump's first term in office. NAFSA, a non-profit organization representing international educators at more than 4,300 institutions worldwide, opposed the 2020 proposal and called on the Trump administration to scrap it. The Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden withdrew it in 2021. The Trump administration has increased scrutiny of legal immigration, revoking student visas and green cards of university students over their ideological views and stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of migrants. In an 22 August memo, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would resume long-dormant visits to citizenship applicants' neighbourhoods to check what it termed residency, moral character and commitment to American ideals.",

    "title": "Venice Film Festival opens with star power, and Gaza protesters",
    "content": "The Venice Film Festival kicked off Wednesday with Hollywood royalty arriving for Italy's glitzy movie showcase where a strong line up of star-packed films will vie with protests about the Gaza war for public attention. Julia Roberts and George Clooney are some of the biggest names at the 82nd edition of the world's longest-running festival, with top directors from Kathryn Bigelow to Jim Jarmusch all due on the sandy Lido across the Venice lagoon. The main event in Wednesday evening's opening ceremony was Francis Ford Coppola awarding a Lifetime Achievement award to German director Werner Herzog ('Grizzly Man', 'Fitzcarraldo') for his canon of more than 70 films. Herzog, who said he always searched for the \"sublime\" in his films, will showcase his latest documentary, 'Ghost Elephants', about a lost herd in Angola, on Thursday. Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's 'La Grazia' -- about an Italian president grappling with doubts over whether to sign a euthanasia bill into law -- was the first main in-competition movie presented on Wednesday. \"Dwelling on doubt and then allowing that doubt to mature into a decision is something that is increasingly rare,\" Sorrentino told journalists. 'Mother', a film depicting Mother Teresa as a sometimes ruthless figure struggling to reconcile her views on motherhood and abortion, opened the secondary Orizzonti section. Eyes were set to quickly turn to Hollywood's favourite leading man, Clooney, who stepped off a water taxi in Venice with his wife Amal on Tuesday. On Thursday, he will be seen in the premiere of Netflix-produced comedy 'Jay Kelly', directed by Noah Baumbach, in which he plays a top Hollywood actor with an identity crisis. On the same night is the premiere of sci-fi comedy 'Bugonia' from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, which stars Emma Stone as a pharmaceutical executive kidnapped by people who mistake her for an alien. Roberts, meanwhile, will appear at Venice for the first time on Friday in the out-of-competition cancel-culture drama \"After the Hunt\", from Italy's Luca Guadagnino. Winners of the festival's prestigious Golden Bear top prize often go on to Oscar glory, such as 'Nomadland' or 'Joker' in previous years. Though the festival and this year's jury president Alexander Payne ('Sideways') were keen to focus on the roster of movies making their world premieres in the next 11 days, world events dominated their day-one press conference. Protesters held up a 'Free Palestine' banner in front of the festival's main building, while a group of Italian film professionals have called on organisers to openly condemn Israel's invasion and siege of Gaza. A demonstration to condemn Israel and the war in Gaza has been called for Saturday in Venice by hundreds of local political and rights groups. The festival had already declared \"huge sadness and suffering vis-a-vis what is happening in Gaza and Palestine\", its director Alberto Barbera told reporters. But he ruled out rescinding invitations to pro-Israeli actors. Israel's nearly two-year bombardment of Gaza also featured prominently during the Cannes film festival in May where hundreds of movie figures signed a petition saying they were \"ashamed\" of their industry's \"passivity\" about the war. The festival has selected a film about the war for its main competition -- 'The Voice of Hind Rajab' by Franco-Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, which reconstructs the death of six-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab who was killed last year by Israeli forces. The flurry of premieres to be screened in Venice also include Guillermo del Toro big-budget remake of 'Frankenstein', starring Oscar Isaac, or Bigelow's political thriller 'A House of Dynamite', starring Idris Elba. In one of the boldest casting choices, British actor Jude Law will try his hand at Vladimir Putin in Olivier Assayas's 'The Wizard of the Kremlin', while Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson portrays mixed martial arts champion Mark Kerr in much-hyped 'The Smashing Machine' from Benny Safdie. Jarmusch marks his first time in Venice's main lineup with 'Father Mother Sister Brother', bringing together Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver and Tom Waits, while Taiwan-born model and actress Shu Qi makes her directorial debut with 'Nuhai (Girl)'.",

    "content": "Pakistan authorities blew up an embankment next to a monsoon-engorged dam on Wednesday as flooding submerged one of the world's holiest Sikh sites. Three transboundary rivers in the east of the country have swollen to exceptionally high levels as a result of heavy rains across the border in India. It has triggered flood alerts throughout Punjab province, home to nearly half of Pakistan's 255 million people. The army was also deployed to help evacuate people and livestock near the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers. Around 210,000 people had moved to another location, according to the disaster authorities. At the Qadirabad dam on the Chenab River, authorities carried out a controlled explosion of an embankment on Wednesday as the water levels rose. \"To save the structure, we have breached the right marginal embankment so that the flow of the water reduces,\" said Mazhar Hussain, a spokesperson for Punjab's disaster management agency. The Kartarpur temple, which marks where the founder of the Sikh faith Guru Nanak is said to have died in 1539, was submerged by floodwater. Five boats were sent to the sprawling site to rescue around 100 stranded people. Pakistan authorities said neighbouring India had released water from upstream dams on its side of the border, further increasing the flow headed towards Pakistan. Islamabad's foreign ministry said New Delhi gave advanced notice through diplomatic channels ahead of opening the spillways. Indian government officials have not commented. The flood surge \"is expected to pass through Lahore tonight and tomorrow morning\", provincial disaster chief Irfan Ali said of the Punjab capital. Pakistan has been battered by a brutal monsoon season this year, with landslides and floods triggered by torrential rain killing more than 800 people since June.",

    "title": "Nvidia beats quarterly earnings expectations",
    "content": "AI powerhouse Nvidia reported quarterly earnings Wednesday that beat expectations, but shares slipped amid concerns about an AI chip spending bubble and the company's stalled business in China. The California-based firm posted profit of $26.4 billion on record revenue of $46.7 billion in the recently ended quarter, driven by intense demand for chips from major tech companies powering AI datacenter computing. While overall revenue significantly increased year-over-year, money taken in from Nvidia's Data Center compute products like its coveted graphics processing units (GPUs) declined 1 percent from the previous quarter. The drop was driven by a $4 billion decrease in sales of H20 chips-specialized processors the company designed for the Chinese market, according to the earnings report. For the current quarter, Nvidia projected $54 billion in revenue but said its forecast assumes no H20 sales. Nvidia's high-end GPUs remain in hot demand from tech giants building data centers for artificial intelligence applications. However, investors are questioning whether the massive AI investments are sustainable. \"The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"At the same time, US export restrictions are fueling domestic chipmaking in China.\" Nvidia shares fell slightly more than 3 percent in after-market trading. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump confirmed that Nvidia would pay the United States 15 percent of its revenues from sales of certain AI chips to China. Trump called Nvidia's H20 chips \"obsolete,\" despite their previous targeting under export restrictions. Beijing has responded by expressing national security concerns about Nvidia chips and urging Chinese businesses to rely on local semiconductor suppliers instead. Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for export to China to address US concerns that its top-tier chips could be used for weapons development or AI applications in the rival nation. \"There is interest in our H20s; we have supply ready to ship,\" Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said of the China market, which he estimated to be a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year. \"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do.\" Huang said Nvidia is talking with the Trump administration about the importance of US companies being able to compete in China. \"We just have to keep advocating the sensibility of, and the importance of, American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard,\" Huang said. The earnings report comes amid market worries about an AI spending bubble that could burst and hurt the chip giant's fortunes. Nvidia serves as a bellwether for the AI market and became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market value last July. \"We're just seeing just enormous amount of interest in AI and demand for AI right now,\" Huang said on an earnings call. The top four cloud computing service providers are on pace to spend about $600 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and it's reasonable to think Nvidia is in line for a lot of that money, Huang reasoned.",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Renowned Bangladeshi mountaineer Wasfia Nazreen conquered the treacherous K2 in Pakistan, becoming the first person from Bangladesh to summit the second-tallest mountain in the world. The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "title": "Crimes against humanity: Formal trial begins in Abu Sayed murder case",
    "content": "The formal trial has commenced in the crimes against humanity case concerning the killing of Abu Sayed, the first martyr of the July Uprising and a student of Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur. The proceedings began at International Crimes Tribunal-2 with the presentation of the opening statement on Wednesday. The three-member tribunal, headed by Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury, heard the opening statement delivered by Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam. In his address, Tajul described Abu Sayed as the “phoenix” of the July Movement and the “vanguard” of the July martyrs. The other two tribunal members are Justice Md Manjurul Basid and Justice Nur Mohammad Shahriar Kabir. Testimony is scheduled to commence Thursday. Former Vice-Chancellor of Begum Rokeya University, Md Hasibur Rashid, along with 30 others, has been indicted in the case. Of them, 24 accused, including the former Vice-Chancellor, remain absconding. The remaining six—former Proctor Shariful Islam, former Assistant Registrar Rafiul Hasan, former contractual employee at the Registrar’s Office Anwar Parvez, former Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police Amir Hossain, former Constable Sujan Chandra Roy, and banned Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Imran Chowdhury alias Akash—were produced before the tribunal yesterday. On 16 July last year, Abu Sayed was shot dead during the anti-discrimination students’ protests in Rangpur. The video footage of his killing shocked the entire nation. It showed him standing on the road with arms outstretched, as police repeatedly fired into his chest. The incident became a turning point for the movement, unleashing outrage across the country. The tribunal’s investigation agency submitted its report against the 30 accused on 24 June this year. On 6 August, formal charges were framed. Aside from the Abu Sayed case, two further trials on crimes against humanity during the uprising are underway. In one of the cases, concerning deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, and former Inspector General of Police Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, 29 witnesses have so far testified. In another case, relating to atrocities in the capital’s Chankharpul area, testimony continues against former Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Habibur Rahman, with eight witnesses examined to date. In his opening statement, Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam recounted that on 16 July, as the protest march advanced from Lalbagh towards Begum Rokeya University, heavily armed police forces obstructed the students. Under the command of then Assistant Commissioner of Rangpur Metropolitan Police, Md Arifuzzaman, five policemen struck Abu Sayed on the head with steel and wooden batons, causing him to bleed. He said former ASI Amir Hossain fired the first shot, hitting Abu Sayed in the abdomen. Though stunned, Sayed once again spread his arms and stood firm. At that point, former Constable Sujan Chandra Roy shot him twice more in the chest, causing him to collapse across the road divider. As fellow students tried to carry him away, protester Tawhidur Haque sustained about 60 shotgun pellets. Abu Sayed died en route to hospital, in the arms of his comrades. Among the 24 absconding accused are former VC Hasibur Rashid, former Associate Professors Moshiur Rahman and Asaduzzaman Mondol, physician Sarwar Hossain (Chandon), former RPMP Commissioner Md Moniruzzaman, former Deputy Commissioner Abu Maruf Hossain, former Additional Deputy Commissioner Shah Nur Alam Patowary, former AC Md Arifuzzaman, University Chhatra League President Pomel Barua, and General Secretary Md Mahafuzur Rahman. Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam argued that the trial could not be stalled by their deliberate absence or asylum abroad. “Even in absentia, justice is not compromised. Under the law, this tribunal retains full authority to deliver verdicts against the absconding accused.” The Chief Prosecutor further claimed that then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had already issued direct orders to fire upon students and protesters, as revealed in her telephone conversation with former Dhaka University Vice-Chancellor ASM Maksud Kamal. He read the transcript aloud to the tribunal. In the call, Sheikh Hasina said, “What kind of country do we live in? Did you not see what happened to the collaborators? We hanged every last one of them, and I will not spare these either.” Maksud Kamal replied: “Yes, once this unrest is over, I myself will expel from the university those at the core of this instability.” Hasina continued: “All of them must be ousted… I am telling you, after today’s tolerance, arrests will follow, and necessary action will be taken. In England, when students take to the streets for politics, did they not kill several of them outright?” Maksud Kamal said, “Yes, yes, yes.” Then Sheikh Hasina said, “There is no alternative to action. We have been far too tolerant… it has come this far.” Recalling the rise of autocrats across history, Tajul Islam said, “Sheikh Hasin",

This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Those who sexually assaulted a female student on Chittagong University campus on July 17 night are members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, said police sources and CU BCL insiders. An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendat",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\".

We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus. Whether there is consensus or not, we said we will continue our efforts.\" ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver.

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "title": "Capacity charge for power: Tk 16,785cr paid in 9 months",
    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions Iga Swiatek scrapped her way into the third round of the US Open on Thursday with a three-set win over Suzan Lamens as Jannik Sinner sought to keep his title defence on track. World number two Swiatek looked to be cruising as she led her Dutch opponent by a set and a break but stumbled before eventually seeing off the 66th-ranked Lamens 6-1, 4-6, 6-4. \"It wasn't an easy match. I did some mistakes,\" said Swiatek. \"I felt like it depended on me and if I made mistakes or not, sometimes I did. I probably got a little tight in the second set. \"But the third set is a reset. You've got to start from the beginning and I knew I could play a little more precisely, so I just tried to do that.\" Swiatek, the 2022 US Open champion, has won 16 of 17 matches following titles at Wimbledon and Cincinnati. She goes on to play Russian 29th seed Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the last 16. Ekaterina Alexandrova, Beatriz Haddad Maia and Linda Noskova were among other women's seeds to advance. Sinner is back in action later on Thursday as he takes on Alexei Popyrin, the Australian who inflicted a shock defeat on Novak Djokovic at last year's tournament. The Italian has won his last 22 matches on hard courts at Grand Slams and said he felt fully healthy again after dealing with illness last week in Cincinnati. He is trying to become the first man to repeat as US Open champion since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004-2008. It is the longest run without a successful men's title defence of any Grand Slam tournament in the Open era. Sinner will be hoping to join Lorenzo Musetti in the next round. The Italian 10th seed matched his best US Open run as he blew past Belgium's David Goffin. Russian 15th seed Andrey Rublev beat American wild card Tristan Boyer in four sets. He advances to a last-32 tie with Hong Kong's Coleman Wong. Wong, a 21-year-old qualifier, extended his New York fairytale with a 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 win over Australian Adam Walton. The 173rd-ranked Wong had already made history earlier in the week by becoming the first man from Hong Kong to win a Grand Slam singles match. Alexander Zverev plays Britain's Jacob Fearnley after Coco Gauff kicks off the night session on Arthur Ashe against Croatia's Donna Vekic. The third-seeded Gauff stumbled through her opening match and admitted the build-up to the tournament had been \"mentally exhausting\" after shaking up her coaching team. Twice former US Open champion Naomi Osaka takes on American Hailey Baptiste after making an encouraging start in her first Grand Slam as a seeded player since 2022. Wimbledon runner-up and eighth seed Amanda Anisimova plays 19-year-old Australian Maya Joint under the lights on Louis Armstrong. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions The plot was nothing special; a patch of sandy ground in front of a tired 90s building in Uttara. A garage, a storage room, a 4x4 bathroom, and some plants left to fend for themselves. Two half-dead trees — one jackfruit, one neem — stood quietly at the edge of being forgotten. But for architect S M Ehsan Uz Zaman, it wasn't just a leftover site. It was memory, erosion, resistance — and eventually, the foundation for what he calls \"The Story of a Tree.\" He convinced his client to work around the land, not over it. And that's how the Albion Art Gallery came to be — not as a sleek intervention, but as a story about not erasing what was already there. Zaman's client, Mahmood Ullah, had a clear ask; an outdoor coffee bar with seating, an exhibition space inside the old garage, and rooftop dining. Trees and ground cover were viewed as obstacles. But when Zaman looked at the site, he didn't see \"undeveloped space.\" He saw something worth preserving. \"It reminded me of Geoffrey Bawa's philosophy,\" he says. \"If you can keep the tree, that's the success of the design.\" So, he kept them. The coffee bar became a smaller coffee station to avoid harming the neem tree. The garage was retrofitted as an indoor gallery with a transparent glass partition, allowing the wild outdoors to bleed into the curated inside. Bamboo and timber were used — materials with a low carbon footprint — so nothing looked like it was trying too hard. Zaman didn't clear the land. He added to it. Not to make a statement, but to make the space feel alive without dominating it. The neem tree was in bad shape. The soil was sandy, eroded, and barely holding together. The logical step would have been to cut it down. Zaman disagreed. He improved the soil with composting and mulching. It took time. It wasn't flashy. But the tree stayed. That one decision meant giving up a few seats in the café plan. But Zaman frames it differently: \"It's a design choice that asks a question — Was saving a neem tree worth sacrificing three café seats?\" Convincing a client to abandon convenience is no easy sell. Zaman pitched it not as an eco-friendly stunt, but as a quality-of-space decision. \"When I said saving the trees would improve the experience of being there, the client came around,\" he says. \"It wasn't about guilt or carbon offsets. It was about atmosphere.\" Zaman doesn't claim Albion Art Gallery is a model for sustainable design. If anything, he's sceptical of how loosely the word is used. \"I don't think this project is a showcase for green architecture,\" he says. \"But maybe it starts a conversation.\" He's critical of how the industry handles ecology. \"As architects, we say we care. But we keep letting trees fall. We put a few planters on balconies and call it sustainability. We cool our buildings with air conditioning instead of shade.\" Zaman's firm, Ehsan Uz Zaman and Associates, takes on all kinds of work — residential, public, and private. But he's most drawn to commercial spaces like cafes and galleries, where design can shape behaviour and not just aesthetics. Asked if he'd host student workshops or open the space up for learning, he's unsure. \"I don't know if this project qualifies as an example,\" he says. \"But maybe it's enough to get people asking better questions.\" Albion Art Gallery isn't perfect. It isn't cutting-edge. And that's the point. It's a quiet project. One where a counter got smaller so a tree could live. One where an architect didn't try to impress anyone — he just refused to erase what was already there. Zaman didn't build for the portfolio. He built for the space. That's the story. And that's enough.

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280. Turnover at the CSE stood at Tk 13.61 crore yesterday, down from Tk 19.5 crore the previous day. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant. Mannan said prices of some items such as rice and edible oil are seeing a downtrend which indicates that inflation will decline in the coming days. He also said the Ecnec meeting discussed the distribution of seeds, fertiliser and pesticides  among marginal farmers free of cost. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

    "content": "Baaji: The cost of Indigenous representation in Coke Studio Bangla Police charge truncheons on students marching to Jamuna Dhaka to bring all buses under unified system Trump's 50% tariffs on India take effect, hiking tensions She was never solely confined to the yellowing pages of a poetry anthology. Ever since its publication, Banalata Sen stepped out from Jibanananda Das's verses to claim her place in every Bengali's heart. Her presence now lingers beyond the quiet gatherings of literature enthusiasts, and lives in the imagination of lovers and dreamers. In the 1990s, sarees first began to be treated as artists' canvases, where poetry and calligraphy were fused to create magic in wearable form. At first, the idea was novel. However, over the years, the concept took root and soon became the perfect garb for soirees, literary gatherings, and poetry recitals. Gradually, visual poetry, woven and painted onto fabric, began to step into more glamorous arenas. No saree exhibition or fashion runway today feels complete without these bold, contemporary style statements. In the latest design of Afsana Ferdousi, the immortal words of Banalata Sen find an unexpected new canvas: the folds of wedding couture. Ferdousi is celebrated for blending sustainability with a seamless fusion of modernity and tradition, and has reimagined Banalata Sen on the six-yard drape. This time, at the special request of a bride-to-be. In the poem, Jibanananda Das uses the image of a weary, long-travelled sailor as a central metaphor. The narrator describes himself as having wandered through the seas for \"a thousand years,\" crossing ancient oceans and lands — from the \"darkness of Ceylon\" to \"the seas of Malaya\" — before finding peace in the quiet gaze of Banalata Sen. In Ferdousi's hands, the saree's zamin and anchal become the sailor's final destination. The central motif of the poem is brought to life as the wanderer's quest meets the artist's muse. Alongside her painted figure, fragments of Jibanananda Das's verse flow across the fabric. With its hand-painted anchal, flowing calligraphy, and meticulous detailing, Ferdousi's creation elevates the bridal saree into a work of art. The bridal wear is a testament to the designer's ability to blend heritage with contemporary designs, crafting a piece that speaks as much of personal style as it does of timeless tradition.

Fatema, who won gold on her international debut at the 2019 South Asian Games in Nepal, is also set to miss the upcoming edition in Pakistan next January, with doctors advising four months of complete rest to recover from the injury sustained during the ongoing national camp. Her absence is expected to take some shine off the competition, although Bangladesh Fencing Federation president Kamrul Islam believes other quality fencers are ready to step up. \"With our support, Fatema Mujib underwent successful surgery at CMH under an orthopaedic surgeon. She now needs four months of rest, as the doctor has advised,\" Islam told reporters yesterday at the NSC conference room. \"I believe there are fencers capable of fighting neck-and-neck, so the spotlight will not fall on her absence alone.\" The two-day championships, part of the government's Festival of the Youth, will feature individual events only -- sabre, foil and epee -- for both men and women. Around 175 fencers from 18 teams, including Bangladesh Army, Navy, Ansar and VDP, Border Guard Bangladesh, private universities and various educational institutes and clubs, are expected to compete. Bangladesh Fencing Federation general secretary Basunia M Ashiqul Islam said new initiatives have been taken to popularise the sport, including introducing fencing training in parts of North Bengal and signing an MoU with American International University of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Suzuki Motorbike Bangladesh has stepped in as a sponsor. \"Suzuki Motorbike always believes in the power of youth, discipline and strong determination, which fencing reflects,\" said managing director Ashiqur Rahman, adding that the company is also involved in sports development and youth empowerment alongside promoting safe transport solutions. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",

Medvedev was fined $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct, and was given a further $12,500 penalty for racquet abuse. The amount is approximately 40 percent of the $110,000 Medvedev received for appearing in the first round at Flushing Meadows. The fiery 29-year-old Russian erupted on Sunday following an incident in the third set when Bonzi was preparing to serve for the match. A photographer mistakenly wandered onto the court, prompting chair umpire Greg Allensworth to award Bonzi a first serve. Medvedev raced across the court to remonstrate with Allensworth, accusing the official of wanting to end the match early. The Russian then turned the to the crowd, encouraging them to vent their displeasure at the umpire, leading to a six-minute delay before Bonzi could finally serve. The Frenchman was subsequently broken but recovered to clinch a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 0-6, 6-4 victory. Medvedev's final act was to violently smash his racquet in anger following the loss. ঢাকা মহানগর পুলিশ এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে, বিভিন্ন সংবাদমাধ্যম ও সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমে প্রচারিত প্রকৌশল শিক্ষার্থীদের বিক্ষোভের সময় এক বিক্ষোভকারীর মুখ চেপে ধরার ছবিটি ‘এআই জেনারেটেড’।",
