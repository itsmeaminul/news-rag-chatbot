    "title": "BUET condemns police attack on protesting engineering students",
    "content": "Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) has condemned the police baton charge on protesting engineering students. The condemnation came in a statement issued today, Wednesday, signed by BUET registrar (Additional Duty) NM Golam Zakaria, and later shared with the media by the university authorities. BUET authorities in the statement noted that students from BUET and other educational institutions have been demonstrating for several days to demand the protection and integration of the rights of BSc (Engineering) graduates in recruitment for the position of assistant engineer or equivalent posts, as well as the elimination of quota-related discrimination in relevant grades. The statement further said that today, as students from BUET and other educational institutions attempted to march toward the residence of the chief adviser at Jamuna to press home their demands, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades at them and carried out a baton charge. As a result, many students were seriously injured. Condemning the police action, the statement said, “Such attacks by the police are completely unacceptable, especially when the issue could have been resolved peacefully.” The BUET administration expressed deep anger and sorrow over the incident and strongly denounced the assault. The statement also expressed hope that the government would take prompt action against those responsible for the attack through a proper investigation. As part of their three-point demand, students yesterday blocked Shahbagh for five hours. Their demands include: Preventing diploma engineers from using the title \"Engineer\" before their names, not promoting any diploma engineers to Grade 9 positions, and reserving Grade 10 engineering jobs exclusively for graduate engineers. The students carried out their pre-announced programme titled \"Long March to Dhaka.\" As part of this, around 11:00am, they began gathering on the main road at Shahbagh, causing traffic in and around the area to come to a halt. Around 1:30pm, the students started marching toward Jamuna, the residence of the Chief Adviser. As they attempted to cross the intersection near the InterContinental Hotel, police intervened. A clash ensued, with both sides chasing each other. Police carried out a baton charge, eventually dispersing the students. According to the protesting students, 50 to 60 of their fellow demonstrators were injured in the police attack. Police, on the other hand, claimed that students had thrown stones and bricks at officers, injuring several members of the force.",

    "title": "Bangladesh wants to purchase 12 J-10C fighter jets from China",
    "content": "The Bangladesh government is interested to purchase J-10C fighter jets manufactured in China for the modernisation of the Bangladesh Air Force. Interim government chief adviser professor Muhammad Yunus brought up this issue during his meeting with China president Xi Jinping last March. Two members of the entourage that accompanied the chief adviser during his China visit confirmed Prothom Alo about Bangladesh’s interest to purchase fighter jets from China. Earlier, on 26 March, the chief adviser went to China on a 4-day official visit. The chief adviser’s press wing said at the time that the two leaders discussed various issues, including Chinese aid in the Teesta project, purchase of multiple combat aircraft, multilateral connection between the ports of Bangladesh and Kunming, China. As part of the modernisation of the three armed forces to prepare them for future challenges, Bangladesh wants to purchase J-10C fighter jets. Wishing to be unnamed two representatives at the policymaking level of the government told Prothom Alo, “At a meeting in Beijing, the chief adviser raised the government’s plan for the modernisation of the Bangladesh Air Force. He expressed interest in purchasing 12 J-10C fighter jets from China, to which the Chinese president responded positively.” Asked about this, adviser to the foreign ministry Touhid Hossain told Prothom Alo that the chief adviser discussed purchasing fighter jets during his meeting with the Chinese president. Diplomatic sources said preliminary discussions between Bangladesh and China on the purchase of J-10C fighter jets had already begun at the official level before the chief adviser’s visit. The matter was raised during the meeting in Beijing, paving the way for the purchase to be implemented. Talks between the two countries on the issue have been continuing since the visit. According to information from various defence-related websites, China’s J-10C fighter jet is also known as the Vigorous Dragon. It is a multirole combat aircraft (MRCA) belonging to the fourth generation, with the capability of carrying out multidimensional operations. The J-10C can fly at supersonic speeds (faster than the speed of sound) and is highly effective in detecting enemy fighter jets. It has both air-to-air and air-to-ground attack capabilities and can strike targets up to 200 kilometres away. The aircraft can also operate in coordination with other fighter jets and drones. In terms of technology, speed, stealth, and surveillance, the J-10C is capable of executing precision attacks while evading enemy detection. Earlier-generation fighter jets had separate roles such as surveillance, bombing from the air, or engaging in dogfights with other fighters. In contrast, a multirole combat aircraft can carry out a wide range of missions such as striking enemy ground bases, tanks, artillery, and infrastructure from the air; conducting surveillance and intelligence gathering; attacking warships at sea; and targeting enemy radar and communication systems to disable them. In short, a single fighter jet is capable of multidimensional operations. After the terrorist attack in Kashmir, in May this year Pakistan claimed that the technological and military capabilities of China’s J-10C were proven. Islamabad said that for the first time, the Chengdu J-10 or J-10C was deployed in direct combat. Pakistan also claimed that with the Chengdu J-10, it had downed a French-made Dassault Rafale fighter jet. Since the fall of the Awami League government in the face of the July uprising, Bangladesh’s relations with both the United States and China have grown visibly closer, with both countries showing interest to deepen ties at various levels with the interim government led by Professor Yunus. However, against the backdrop of geopolitics, Washington has been keeping a sharp eye on China’s presence in Bangladesh, as it does in other regions of the world. As a result, the China issue has come up in different rounds of discussions between Dhaka and Washington. Across administrations of both the Democratic and Republican parties, the White House has remained curious about Bangladesh’s growing intimacy with China. Senior US officials have indicated to Dhaka that they have no objection if Bangladesh expands cooperation with China in trade and other areas. But a deepening of defence or military cooperation with Beijing is viewed as unsettling for Washington. Asked about the plan to purchase J-10C fighter aircraft from China, retired Major General ANM Muniruzzaman, president of the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies (BIPSS), told Prothom Alo that the aircraft’s success in the short India-Pakistan conflict in May had proven its technological capabilities. This purchase, he said, would significantly enhance Bangladesh’s defence capacity. On the other hand, it could also create challenges in the realm of international relations. He further said Bangladesh should proceed with caution in this procurement",

    "content": "People living in the villages around Ratargul Forest are dependent on the freshwater swamp forest for their livelihood as hundreds of tourists flock there to enjoy the scenic beauty of the forest. Many local people maintain their life by operating boats in the forest carrying tourists while many others are running small business. Boatman Raju Miah, a resident of Aulatuk village near Ratargul Forest, said he runs a tourist boat from Motor ghat and earn Taka 200 for every trip. He said during the pick season, he can operate six to eight trips everyday against two trips during off season. Noting that a total of 45 boats run from Motor ghat, Raju Miah said, \"We depend on tourists. If they do not come, we will fall in trouble.\" Locals said people of some 10 village depend on the forest to maintain their livelihood. Boatmen said about 200 boats run every day from three ghats- Ratargul ghat, Motor ghat and Chiringgi ghat. Shop keeper Quyyum said he run a small business at Motor ghat and his selling depends on tourists. Mohammad Masum, a tourist who came from Narayanganj with his family, said they were visiting Ratargul for the first time as it is a very popular tourist spot. \"We are very happy enjoying the beauty of the swamp forest,\" he said. Ratargul Swamp Forest is located in Gowain River, Fatehpur Union, Gowainghat, Sylhet. Ratargul was once thought to be the only swamp forest in Bangladesh and one of the few freshwater swamp forests in the world. According to the Forest Department, the total area of the Ratargul forest is about 3,325 acres. Of those, 504 acres was declared as the wildlife sanctuary in 2015. The evergreen forest is situated by the river Goain and linked with the channel Chengir Khal. Most of the trees growing here are the Dalbergia reniformis (Koroch tree). Usually the forest remains under 20–30 feet water during the rainy season. Rest of the year, water level of the forest remains about 10 feet deep.",

Acting Judge of the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Court Md Ibrahim Mia passed the order after hearing a petition filed by ACC. Assistant Director of ACC Minhaz bin Islam also the investigating officer of the case, sought 10-day remand for him. Detectives arrested Kalimullah from Dhaka's Mohammadpur area in a graft case on 7 August. ACC filed a case against five people including Kalimullah and former vice-chancellor of the university AKM Nurun Nabi in a graft case on 18 June.According to the case statement, all of them in collusion with each other changed the design of the Begum Rokeya University Development Project through abusing power disregarding the Development Project Proposal (DPP). They allegedly signed contracts exceeding Tk 300 million in value without seeking approval from the relevant ministry or department. Besides, they were also involved in misusing security deposits deducted from the contractor's running bills by keeping them as Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) in a bank and subsequently issued No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to allow the contractor to secure loans against those FDRs, embezzling Tk 40 million from government funds.",

    "title": "New demands raised deliberately to foil election: Mirza Fakhrul",
    "content": "BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has said that new demands are being raised every day deliberately to thwart the election. Mirza Fakhrul said that some political quarters are unfortunately making new demands in a very calculated way to foil and disrupt the election. They are raising demands that are unfamiliar to the people of Bangladesh. He made these remarks today, Wednesday, as the chief guest at a discussion meeting marking the 10th death anniversary of Kazi Zafar Ahmad, one of the organisers of the Liberation War. The discussion was organised by the Bhasani Janashakti Party at the Zahur Hossain Chowdhury Hall of the National Press Club in Dhaka. Mentioning that political parties are fully cooperating with the interim government on reforms, Mirza Fakhrul said they have not created any obstacles anywhere. They have never embarrassed the government by raising major demands and taking to the streets. The BNP Secretary General said the people of the country are familiar with the word ‘reform’. It will take time for them to understand the proportional representation (PR) system. It is very difficult to explain this to people. Moreover, voters would not know who they are voting for. Yet, many are talking about implementing these changes and issuing threats. Mirza Fakhrul recalled that seven to eight days after the mass uprising, he had demanded elections within three months at a programme in front of the BNP central office. He noted that he had to face a lot of criticism for this, adding that whenever there is a change, others try to take advantage of it. The BNP Secretary General believes that if the national election had been held within three months of the mass uprising, the economy would not be in such a dire state. If elections had been held within that time, an elected government with a mandate and public support could have swept away these forces. He also said there are attempts to erase the memory of the great Liberation War. There is a strong effort to make us forget 1971, but that cannot be forgotten. Those who collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces are the ones speaking loudly today. That is why we must remain very alert and cautious. Mirza Fakhrul remarked that a quarter within the government is deliberately trying to prevent pro-democracy forces from coming to power. He stressed that much more needs to be done to achieve the desired goal. Referring to S Alam Group, he said the group gave Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, who is staying in India, Tk 25 billion to foil the elections. He alleged that plans are being made on how to use that money to block elections in Bangladesh and bring Sheikh Hasina back to the country. Mirza Fakhrul urged the government to complete the formulation of the July Charter at the earliest without creating further complications and to arrange elections as announced. The discussion was presided over by Bhasani Janashakti Party Chairman Sheikh Rafiqul Islam and conducted by the party’s Secretary General Abu Yusuf. Other speakers included Biplobi Workers Party General Secretary Saiful Haque, Jatiya Party (Kazi Zafar) Chairman Mostafa Jamal Haider, and BNP Chairperson’s adviser Nazmul Haque Nannu, among others.",

    "title": "India faces world football ban for second time in 3 years",
    "content": "India could be banned from world football for the second time in three years after FIFA and the Asian governing body demanded it implement a new constitution by 30 October or risk suspension. World governing body FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) sent a joint letter to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey expressing \"profound concern\" at the continued failure to finalise and adopt the constitution. \"Failure to meet this schedule will leave us with no alternative but to refer the matter to the relevant FIFA decision-making body for consideration and decision,\" said the letter, seen by AFP. \"AIFF must regard this communication as binding and requiring immediate compliance in order to safeguard its rights as a member of FIFA and the AFC,\" it added. The AIFF constitution has been in India's Supreme Court awaiting a decision since 2017. A suspension would mean India national teams and clubs being barred from all international competitions. FIFA previously suspended India in August 2022 for third-party influence after the Supreme Court appointed a committee of administrators to run the AIFF. The ban was lifted a few days later, paving the way for the AIFF to elect Chaubey. India's top-flight club football is currently in disarray. The Indian Super League (ISL) could fold over a dispute between the AIFF and its commercial partner. This season's ISL kickoff has been delayed with thousands of players and staff in danger of losing their jobs. A rights agreement between the AIFF and the company that runs the ISL, Football Sports Development Limited, ends on 8 December and is yet to be renewed. The AIFF has been unable to come up with a revival plan for the ISL, which is usually played between September and April. Players union FIFPRO Asia/Oceania raised the issue with FIFA last week.",

A circular will be issued within a week to invite investors for the service, Bangladesh Bank (BB) governor Ahsan H Mansur said. Speaking as chief guest at the “Cashless Bangladesh Summit 2025,” jointly organised by ICMAB and Mastercard at Hotel Sonargaon in Dhaka on Wednesday, the BB governor disclosed the decision. He said, “When it comes to MFS, unfortunately, we still have only one major player in the market. More activities, competition, and new investments are needed in this sector. For this reason, a decision has been taken to bring Nagad under private ownership and attract investment.” Nagad will be removed from the control of the postal department, he said adding that the department no longer has the capacity to manage such a service. A technology company will have to be brought in as the main shareholder of Nagad. The governor also said that major reforms had already been carried out in Nagad. The problems caused by irregularities linked to its former owners, particularly regarding the EoC, had been resolved. Around 15 million fake or inactive accounts had been eliminated, and the organisation is now being restructured. Highlighting the need for a strategic investor in the technology sector, Ahsan H Mansur said, “What we need now is an organisation like bKash, which can invest gradually and increase its shareholding in Nagad. We hope to revive Nagad as a strong competitor.” He expressed optimism that Nagad could indeed be revitalised as a worthy competitor. National Board of Revenue chairman Md Abdur Rahman Khan, finance secretary Khairuzzaman Mozumder, and City Bank PLC managing director and CEO Mashrur Arefin, among others, also addressed the event.",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The World Court yesterday rejected Myanmar's objections to a genocide case over its treatment of the Muslim Rohingya minority, paving the way for the case to be heard in full. Myanmar, now ruled by a military junta that seized power in 2021, had argued that Gambia, which brought the suit, had no standing to do so at the top UN court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But presiding Judge Joan Donoghue said the 13 judge panel found that all members of the 1948 Genocide Convention can and are obliged to act to prevent genocide, and the court has jurisdiction in the case. \"Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide convention, has standing,\" she said, reading a summary of the ruling. The court will now proceed to hearing the merits of the case, a process that will take years. Bangladesh has welcomed the judgment. \"Bangladesh maintains that the question of international justice and accountability will be critical in finding a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis, and would also prove to be a confidence building measure for the sustainable repatriation of the Rohingyas to their homes in Myanmar with their legitimate rights restored,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said in a statement. Gambia, which took up the cause after its then-attorney general visited a refugee camp in Bangladesh, argues that all countries have a duty to uphold the 1948 Genocide Convention. It is backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in a suit aiming to hold Myanmar accountable and prevent further bloodshed. A separate UN fact-finding mission concluded that a 2017 military campaign by Myanmar that drove 730,000 Rohingyas into neighbouring Bangladesh had included \"genocidal acts\". While the court's decisions are binding and countries generally follow them, it has no way of enforcing them. In a 2020 provisional decision it ordered Myanmar to protect the Rohingya from genocide, a legal victory that established their right under international law as a protected minority. However, Rohingya groups and rights activists say there has been no meaningful attempt to end their systemic persecution and what Amnesty International has called a system of apartheid. Rohingyas are still denied citizenship and freedom of movement in Myanmar. Tens of thousands have now been confined to squalid displacement camps for a decade, reports Reuters. The junta has imprisoned democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who defended Myanmar personally in 2019 hearings in The Hague. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

The 39-year-old reached the top of the 8,611-metre (28,251-foot) mountain early Thursday, AFP reported yesterday. According to a 2019 National Geographic article, K2 is widely considered the toughest and most dangerous mountain to climb. Nicknaming K2 the \"Savage Mountain\", the article said, \"Unlike Everest, it is not possible to 'walk' to the top; all sides of K2 are extremely steep and see frequent rockfalls and avalanches.\" Wasfia also climbed Everest, the world's highest peak, in 2012. On her Facebook page, the mountaineer on Sunday sought thoughts and prayers from her fans and well-wishers saying she was heading out to summit K2 that night with the strongest team. \"If all goes well, good news will come in a week,\" she wrote. Wasfia is best known for being the only Bangladeshi to climb the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains of every continent. Her expedition consisted of some of the strongest and most renowned climbers in the world -- Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, and Nirmal Purja. K2 is deemed notorious for its harsh conditions -- winds can blow at more than 200 kilometres per hour and temperatures can drop to negative 60 degrees Celsius. It has only been scaled by 425 people since 1954 -- including around 20 women. According to the 2019 National Geographic article, \"Of the 14 mountains that rise at least 8,000 metres (26,246 feet), K2 remains the only peak unclimbed during winter.\" Located in the Karakorum Range in northern Pakistan near the country's border with China, K2 is thought to be the world's most dangerous mountain. Pakistan is home to five of the world's 14 mountains higher than 8,000 metres, and climbing them all is considered the ultimate achievement of any mountaineer. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

An officer of Hathazari Police Station, preferring anonymity, told The Daily Star, \"From witnesses and substantial evidence, we have gathered that the accused are Chhatra League activists. But their faces could not be identified from the CCTV footage.\" According to the CU Proctor Office, the university has around 135 CCTV cameras. However, only half of those have night vision. Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Hathazari Model Police Station, said, \"We are working to arrest those involved in the incident. However, their identities could not be confirmed, as CCTV footage is not clear and of poor quality. But my teams are working and we are hoping to get results soon.\" He, however, declined to comment on the involvement of BCL men until the investigation is complete. Meanwhile, teachers and students of the university alleged the CU administration has been negligent in involving the law enforcers. Following the incident, former leaders of CU BCL, on their Facebook profiles, criticised the roles of the current Chhatra League leaders and demanded exemplary punishment to the abusers. The victim, who is a first-year student of the Arts Faculty, filed a case against unidentified people under the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act with Hathazari Police Station on Wednesday night. In the case statement, she said that on Sunday night a group of five men forcibly picked her and her friend up from Hotashar Mor to the Botanical Garden. They first beat the two up and then tied up the plaintiff and sexually assaulted her. When her friend tried to save her, the abusers snatched one of their mobile phones and left the area. Before filing a case with the police, the victim filed a complaint with the proctorial body. The CU admin, instead of taking measures to punish the perpetrators, instructed the female students to return to their dormitories by 10:00pm \"to avoid such situations\". The proctorial body did not inform the police about the sexual assault, a criminal offence, even after receiving a complaint, CU students said. Proctor Robiul Hasan Bhuiyan, however, refuted the allegation, saying they had informed the police but the victim was unwilling to cooperate initially. \"The [victim] student came to us on Monday morning [a day after the incident]. We immediately started checking the CCTV footage, but she did not recall the exact time. We then asked her to go to the police, but she said she would think about it. \"When she agreed, me and two assistant proctors took her took her to the police station.\" There was no negligence on the university authority's end, he added. Protests against the incident began on Wednesday night, as hundreds of female resident students laid siege to the vice chancellor's office. They also placed a four-point demand, which included assurance of justice and punishment to the attackers within four working days, and round-the-clock security for all students. The protesters further demanded the proctorial body step down if it failed to bring justice within four days. The female students also asked the administration to properly investigate all the complaints filed with the CU Sexual Harassment Prevention Cell. Yesterday morning, hundreds of students from CU's chemistry department staged a demonstration in front of the university's administrative building from around 11:00am. Several teachers from different departments joined them. Under the banner of Progotishil Chhatra Jote and General Students of CU, the students also brought out a procession from the administrative building and marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. Addressing the demonstrators, Vice Chancellor Shireen Akhter said the demands would be met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, BCL central unit has served a show-cause notice to Rezaul Haque Rubel, president of CU BCL, a day after the incident, for violating the organisation's discipline. BCL insiders said Rubel was served the notice as he had asked the victim not to file a complaint with the CU authorities. Speaking to The Daily Star, Rubel, however, said he was asked to show cause as he failed to discharge some of his organisational duties. \"But my rivals are now trying to link me to this incident.\" He claimed he did not ask anyone not to file a complaint; instead, he directly informed the matter to an assistant proctor and an on-duty police official. Iqbal Hossain Tipu, general secretary of CU BCL, told The Daily Star, \"We demand exemplary punishment to the abusers. Their only identity is that they are abusers.\" Former CU BCL president Md Alamgir Tipu said, \"Those who are directly i",

    "title": "Yet-to-start mega projects: Consider putting  them on hold",
    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand Given the current economic situation, the government should consider suspending mega projects the physical work of which has yet to begin, economist Debapriya Bhattacharya said yesterday. Unless these projects are of utmost importance, they should be put on hold, he said. \"Bangladesh needs to be wary of the debt situation as well, since it may become somewhat tricky in 2024-26 as the repayment schedule for many of the high value loans will kick off around that time,\" he said at a virtual dialogue titled Top 20 Mega Projects in Bangladesh: Trends and Status. \"There is a need for defining a repayment strategy, including rescheduling of imminent payments, given the current account and foreign reserve status. \"Very close monitoring will be paramount to keep the debt situation in check.\" Debapriya also said the government should review several projects in which there was \"visible corruption\". The comments come at a time when the country is struggling with dwindling foreign currency reserves, runaway inflation, and energy crisis. Debapriya and his team researched on 20 most expensive mega projects, including the Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, and three metro rail projects. The total implementation cost of the 20 projects is Tk 556,955.74 crore, of which 61.17 percent is supposed to be foreign assistance. Foreign sources are supposed to finance over 50 percent of 14 of the 20 projects. There are 11 transportation and communication sector projects and four electricity and fuel sector projects. The projects related to electricity and fuel are much larger and more foreign-finance dependent, he said. There are two education sector projects, two health sector projects, and one housing project, he said. \"It seems that the mega projects have come at the expense of fiscal allocations for social sectors including health, education and social protection.\" The lack of transparency and accountability along with delay in implementation have affected the reserve. Implementation of the 20 mega projects involve 40 loan packages and five grants. Of the total foreign finance, almost 84.4 percent is in grants and concessional loans. Two semi-concessional loans (4.4 percent) are supposed to come from Russia while five non-concessional loans (11.1 percent) are supposed to come from China. Thirteen loan packages amounting to $32.26 billion are due for repayment by 2024. Around 57.5 percent of the loans have a grace period of 10 years while 72.5 percent have repayment period of 20 years and beyond. Debapriya said the review of terms and conditions of foreign loans for the top 20 mega projects are favourable as there are a good number of concessional loans along with grants. The economist commented that he saw the negotiation between the government and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a positive development because an IMF loan will help stabilise the economic condition and improve confidence of foreign investors and development partners. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The High Court yesterday came down hard on Bangladesh Railway for mismanagement, ticket scalping and carrying passengers on the train roofs. \"If any train carries passengers on its roof, appropriate actions will be taken against the officials concerned,\" said the court. The bench of Justice Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice Khizir Hayat made the remarks during a suo moto proceedings on this issue. The HC bench ordered the rail authorities to inform it by July 31 what steps have been taken to stop passengers journeying on the train roofs and ticket scalping -- a practice of illegally purchasing tickets for reselling them at an inflated price. During the proceedings, the HC asked two railway officials, \"Why is there so much mismanagement in rail services? Why will ticket scalping take place? Why will people travel on the roof of the trains?\" Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, the bench observed. Earlier on the day, Joint Director General of Bangladesh Railway AM Salahuddin and Director (Traffic) Md Nahid Hasan Khan and sohoz.com official Zunayer Hossain appeared before the HC bench to convey the steps taken to prevent mismanagement in the railway services. AM Salahuddin told the HC bench they have some limitations in preventing passengers from travelling on the roof. The HC bench then asked the official whether the passengers on the roofs pay fares. If the passengers are allowed to travel on the roof even after they pay fares, it is outright corruption and must be stopped at any cost, the HC bench said, adding that accidents might take place if people are allowed to be on the roofs. \"You cannot remain silent. This cannot be allowed. You must discharge your duties properly,\" Justice Nazrul Islam Talukder told the officials. Deputy Attorney General AKM Amin Uddin Manik told the court the railway authorities have taken steps to form a committee to probe the mismanagement in services. The issues came to the fore after Dhaka University student Mohiuddin Roni waged a protest lately. On Wednesday, the HC bench wanted to know about the sit-in programme enforced by Roni demanding improvement of railway services and about the steps taken to this effect. The bench delivered the order on a suo moto move following a photo of Roni and a caption published on The Daily Star yesterday. Senior lawyer Khusrhid Alam Khan appeared for the Anti-Corruption Commission during the proceedings. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand All newspapers owned by the members of Newspaper Owners' Association of Bangladesh (Noab) will see a price increase of at least Tk 2 per issue from July 25. This was announced in a statement issued by Noab yesterday. It means newspapers which now sell for Tk 10 a copy will be sold for Tk 12 and those priced at Tk 5 will be sold for Tk 7. \"The newspaper industry all over the world had been going through different crises. The revenue from both advertisement and circulation had been dropping. This crisis further deepened due to the pandemic in 2020. Despite all these, we did not increase the prices of newspapers,\" said the statement. \"The cost of our publication has increased hugely. The price of newsprint, our primary raw material, went up in the middle of last year. The price has doubled in the last few months than in the first half of last year. In addition, the exchange rate of US dollar also increased. Printing costs have also soared because of the rise in prices of ink, plates and other necessary materials.\" As transportation costs have also risen, the expenses of newspapers have doubled as a cumulative effect, it added. On the other hand, Noab over the last few months has repeatedly sought government assistance, but has not received the expected response, said the statement. \"Even though all industries were given stimulus packages by the government, the newspaper industry did not receive any assistance. At the same time, corporate tax, import duty and other taxes [including VAT] remained unchanged in this fiscal year's national budget.\" The Noab said the industry is going through an unprecedented crisis. \"We know that our readers and well-wishers are our biggest strength. We are pledge-bound to deliver the best possible newspapers to you. We seek cooperation from all our readers and well-wishers,\" said Noab. However, it is to be noted that the price of The Daily Star will not increase because it was hiked to Tk 15 on July 1. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The government's plan for one to two hours of daily power cuts is failing, especially in the north, and the signs are that the electricity crisis may worsen across the country in the coming days. The north is already seeing three to four hours of load shedding a day with Rangpur being the worst affected. The government on Sunday announced a schedule for area-based power cuts to mitigate the electricity crisis. Experts have warned that with the dwindling fuel stocks, the duration of power outages would surely increase in the days ahead. They also pointed fingers at underutilised coal-fired plants and inadequate transmission lines. With the crisis deepening, the government yesterday came up with some new measures to cut power usage. It directed the public offices to cut consumption by 25 percent. Officials have been asked to avoid, as much as possible, having in-person meetings to reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Bangladesh Power Development Board has been generating 500MW a day more from coal-based plants compared to what it produced on June 29, when the load shedding began. But the Barapukuria Power Station in Dinajpur has been gobbling up its stocks of coal without replenishment. The coal production at its mine was suspended in late April for underground development work, and the plant would not get fresh coal until the middle of August, said sources. The plant now has a coal stock for only 15 days, even though it is generating only 200MW with a capacity of 525MW. An official of the Barapukuria coal mine said the plant might have to stop generation due to the shortage of coal. Data from Nesco, the power distributor for northern districts, shows it received 500MW yesterday, about half of what it needs. The demand-supply gap resulted in serious power cuts in the north. Officials of Dhaka's two distributors -- DPDC and DESCO -- told The Daily Star that they got less power than required and that they could not maintain one to two hours of load shedding in some areas. Shamim Hasan, director (public relations) of Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), said they received some allegations that the distribution companies failed to maintain the schedule but \"that was not at a large scale\". The coal-fired 1,320MW Payra Power Plant is producing 1,000-1,050MW, but it can only supply the power to the Barishal-Khulna region as the transmission line to Dhaka is yet to be completed. On top of the issues with coal-fired plants, the stock of furnace oil is running low. A Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation official told The Daily Star, \"We have only 1.2 lakh tonnes of furnace oil in stock against the monthly requirement of 55,000 tonnes.\" The official said the stock was below the standard practice and the BPC was yet to buy its next consignment of furnace oil. Bangladesh has a capacity to generate 22,348MW electricity. Of that, around 52 percent is from gas-based plants, 27 percent from furnace oil-based plants, 5.86 percent from diesel-based, 8.03 percent from coal-powered plants, 1 percent from hydro, 0.5 percent from other renewable energies, and 5.27 percent is imported, according to the BPDB data. The government this week decided to shut 10 diesel power plants. Last month, it stopped importing LNG from the high-priced spot market, and the power cuts began after this. LNG injection into the national gas grid has slipped further in recent days, Petrobangla data shows. Yesterday, it was 430 million cubic feet (mmcfd). On June 29, the injection was 854 mmcfd and in the first week of July, it was 500 mmcfd. The country is generating 12,000-13,000MW electricity a day against a demand of 14,000-14,500MW. Talking to The Daily Star, energy expert M Shamsul Alam said, \"The schedule [for power cuts] was not made to be maintained automatically. It will be manually implemented and the negligence and ignorance of officials may ruin this process.\" He observed that there needs to be more professional efficiency. Amid this situation, the state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd suspended production due to gas shortage on Tuesday night. Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd, the country's largest urea producer, had shut down earlier for the same reason. Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque yesterday said the government was trying to find alternative sources of fertiliser. \"We're trying to make both Jamuna Fertiliser Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Ltd operational. The government has to provide gas to bring these two factories back into operation.\" Senior secretaries and secretaries of all the ministries and divisions sat at the PMO yesterday to find ways to reduce expenditure. The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Ahmad Kaikaus, came up with six decisions and recommendatio",

BNP leaders said they shunned the talks because it was impossible for the EC to hold a free and fair election under the incumbent government. Election commissioners yesterday said  they would \"wait\" for the BNP until the election and they might contact the opposition parties \"time and again\". Late last month, the BNP and several other parties skipped the EC's views-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. BNP Standing Committee Member Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said, \"Our decision is that we will not join an election under the current government. We have not joined the process of forming this Election Commission, have not given them recognition, and have not taken part in any activities of the commission. We have not changed our stance and that is why we did not join the talks.\" While talking to reporters at the EC office, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Kazi Habibul Awal said he would not comment on whether the commission will take any special measures to bring the BNP to the dialogue. Election Commissioner Md Alamgir said, \"It would have been better if they [the BNP] joined the talks. The talks are going well because political parties are giving thoughtful opinions. These will help us hold a better election. \"We are repeatedly taking initiatives to [bring the BNP to the talks]. We will contact them time and again.\" The EC's latest talks with political parties started on Sunday. Eleven parties have participated while the BNP, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and Bangladesh Muslim League shunned the talks. On March 13, the EC began another round of talks with a cross section of people, including educationists, civil society members, journalists, former CECs and ECs, and local election observers. The CEC yesterday said, \"It is really our sole responsibility to ensure that every voter can cast their vote freely. This is the foundation of democracy. And for this, everyone's cooperation is needed. Every party has said they believe in political consensus.

One-and-a-half-year-old Farhana died at Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital, her mother Shathi, 22, died on the way to the facility and aunt Tanjila, 30, died at the scene, police said, adding that the family is from Gaurnadi upazila of Barishal. The other deceased are Bakerganj residents Sohag Shikder, 21, Hasib Khan, 25, and Amir Chowdhury, 50. Two others injured in the crash are being treated at the hospital with serious injuries. The bus of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation, going towards Barishal from Kuakata, was on the wrong side of the road when it collided with the auto-rickshaw coming from the opposite direction. The crash happened in front of a fire service office, said Bakerganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sajal Chandra Shil, adding that the driver managed to flee the scene. Alauddin Milan, officer-in-charge of Bakerganj Police Station, said the auto-rickshaw got completely mangled in the impact. Shah Alam, assistant director at Bangladesh Road Transport Authority office in Barishal, said the bus had no fitness certificate since May 28, 2015, and its registration expired towards the end of 2017. \"We cannot say anything about the driver because we do not have the identity of the driver.

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The government has shut down diesel-run power plants and mulls some other steps to tackle the ongoing energy crisis. The Daily Star spoke to Badrul Imam, energy expert and former professor of geology at Dhaka University, for some insights into the matter. According to him, a comprehensive assessment of the situation was not done before deciding to shut down the power plants. He believes that instead of taking such temporary measures, the government should take up specific and effective plans. \"Did the government take note of the overall situation before making such a decision? Or was it just to say 'see, we have shut down the diesel-run plants'?\" the former professor asked. \"Before shutting down the power plants, it should have come up with estimates on how much energy will be preserved by doing so. \"Despite the closure of the plants, diesel use in other sectors is bound to rise [due to the crisis]. The generators that we use in our farms, factories and homes -- they all run on diesel. Load shedding will only increase the use of the fuel in these generators.\" Badrul further said, \"This was a piecemeal decision…Our problems can't be solved by piecemeal management ...\" Due to such an approach, the chances of solving the problem have become slim. According to the expert, the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources. \"The current state we are in is thanks to our liquified natural gas [LNG] purchases.In the global market, the price of LNG is $40 per MMBtu . But we get local gas at $1-3 at best per unit. Thus, we should focus on the gas reserves we have -- the one geologists can't stop talking about. \"We have to take up specific and appropriate plans. Geologists across the globe say the Bengal delta is a highly prospective gas-rich province and this a textbook statement. So there really is no reason for us to not have abundant gas reserves. Why aren't we focusing on that?\" Badrul also said, \"Till date, we have utilised 18 to 20 trillion cubic feet [TCF] of gas. However, geologists believe we still have more than twice that amount.\" According to a survey conducted by the USGS-Petrobangla, the amount of undiscovered gas in Bangladesh is 32 TCF, while another survey, conducted by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and Bangladesh Energy and Mineral Resources Division, puts the amount at 42 TCF. \"We are claiming there's a gas crisis. What is the basis of this claim? This is an unwise statement and we must be realistic. We need wide-scale exploration drives, and only that will help us find a solution.\" The government is also considering keeping petrol pumps closed one day a week. About this, he reiterated, \"Piecemeal management will not be enough to solve the current crisis. This [decision] will only increase the public sufferings as people will not get petrol and will have to wait in queues.\" He concluded, \"Only we are to blame for the current situation. This problem was man-made, and we created it ourselves. We need to come out of it ourselves. \"We have the key to solving this problem and we need to unearth undiscovered gas reserves and extract the gas as soon as possible.\" সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The government paid Tk 16,785 crore in capacity charges to power plants in the first nine months of the last fiscal year for 22,118MW daily power generation capacity. But the government had not been able to use more than 14,000MW a day during that period as the country's electricity demand was not higher than this. As per the government's agreement with power plants, the government has to pay \"capacity charges\" based on the plant's capacity and establishment costs, regardless of whether the power is bought or produced. The current demand for electricity ranges between 14,000MW and 14,500MW, but the government is producing 12,000-13,000MW, leading to ongoing power outages. The government continues to pay for that unutilised power when austerity has been prescribed across all spheres to cope with rising inflation at home and abroad. The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), the country's sole electricity buyer, paid Tk 18,977 crore to 101 power plants in 2020-21 and Tk 18,123 crore to 102 plants in 2019-20. The BPDB submitted this data to the parliamentary standing committee on power, energy and mineral resources ministry in a meeting yesterday. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the submitted papers. On Monday, the government shut down all diesel-fired power plants due to depleting fuel stocks, meaning 1,000-1,500MW remains unutilised daily but payment for the capacity continues. The same day, the government also announced up to two hours of load shedding across the country. Experts have suggested renegotiating capacity payments with power plant owners as the government is now struggling to cope with the decreasing forex reserves and capacity charges have to be paid in dollars. In a report in February, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the government paid Tk 8,929 crore in \"capacity payments\" in 2019-20 and Tk 13,200 crore in 2020-21. But these numbers were dwarfed by those provided by the BPDB in the meeting with the standing committee yesterday. The subsidy package for the power sector was Tk 7,400 crore in the 2019-20 budget, Tk 8,900 crore in the 2020-21 budget and Tk 12,000 crore in the 2021-22 budget, but the capacity payments alone are greater. \"It is not possible to renegotiate the capacity payments at this moment as those are settled by the agreements between the government and individual power plant owners,\" said Waseqa Ayesha Khan, president of the standing committee. \"But the [BPDB] officials at the meeting said when renewing agreements with some owners, the parties agreed that there would be no payments if electricity is not bought.\" Contacted yesterday, CPD's Research Director Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem told The Daily Star that both the government and the people have to bear the brunt of capacity payment. The government needs to give huge subsidies for capital payment. \"The government could have saved huge revenue, had it been able to avoid such staggering sums of capacity charges,\" he said, adding that it is because around 42 to 48 percent of power generation capacity is not being used. He also said the government should phase out inefficient or defunct power plants from the national grid, which are still getting capacity payments. The government should also renegotiate regarding different clauses on capacity payment and try to ensure that capacity payment is not included in renewal contracts in any form, he said. The Bangladesh-China Power Company limited -- owner of the 1,320MW Payra coal-fired power plant -- was paid the highest capacity charge of Tk 2,277 crore in the first nine months of the last fiscal year because half of its capacity remained unutilised till April this year. \"For the delay of about one and a half years [in utilising the second unit that started commercial operation in December 2020], BPDB had to pay the power plant over Tk 253 crore monthly,\" said a BPDB official. According to BPDB data, in 2019-20, between Tk 400 crore and Tk 600 crore was paid in capacity payments each to independent power plants Sembcorp NWPC Ltd of Sirajganj; APR Energy Ltd at Keraniganj; Summit Meghnaghat Power Ltd and Meghnaghat Power Ltd in Narayanganj; and United Anowara Ltd. Among rental power plants, Khulna Power Company Ltd, owned by Summit Group, was paid Tk 160 crore in capacity payments, the highest in 2019-20; in 2020-21, Dutch Bangla Power and Associates were paid the highest Tk 182 crore; and Acron Infrastructure Services Ltd of Chattogram was paid Tk 100 crore, the highest in the first nine months of 21-22. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

If all concerned can pursue austerity, the country will benefit, she said yesterday while chairing the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) this fiscal year. The PM joined the meeting virtually from the Gono Bhaban while ministers, state ministers, members of the Planning Commission and secretaries concerned attended the meeting at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area. Later, Planning Minister MA Mannan told reporters that the PM urged everyone to maintain austerity in all spheres. \"… The prime minister has asked the government machinery as well as the common people to maintain austerity.\" Mannan further said Bangladesh is feeling the pinch of the fuel price hike and the current global volatility. State Minister for Planning Shamsul Alam said the PM reiterated her call for all to maintain austerity and avoid wasting resources. She gave a directive for limiting the use of air conditioners in public offices and also asked government employees not to wear suits in summer. Alam mentioned that the PM gave approval to a project for supplying gas to Mymensingh Combined Cycle Power Plant.

    "title": "Parties can’t be forced to join nat’l polls: CEC",
    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal yesterday said it's not possible to force any political party to take part in the next national election. \"We will not force any party to join the polls ... Nobody will take part in the election just because we are urging them,\" the CEC said during talks with political parties at the Election Commission office in the capital. The EC organised it as part of a series of dialogue seeking recommendations from a cross section of people on how to hold a free and fair general election. Awal said they will continue to appeal to all political parties for joining the next general polls that may be held in late December 2023 or early January 2024. The CEC's comments came as Bangladesh Kalyan Party, a partner of the BNP-led 20-party combine, skipped the talks with the EC yesterday. According to sources in the BNP, the party will not participate in the dialogue with the EC scheduled for today. \"The party has decided not to join the ongoing talks with the Election Commission … We have no interest in sitting with it,\" Sayrul Kabir Khan, a member of the BNP chairperson's press wing, told this newspaper yesterday. Late last month, the BNP and several other like-minded parties skipped the EC-organised view-exchange programmes on electronic voting machines. The commission took the initiative to earn political parties' trust over EVM use. \"We are trying to hold an inclusive election. We will not be able to bring anyone [to the election] forcibly, and we will not try that,\" Awal said during talks with Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal yesterday. \"If everyone joins the polls, we will be happy … We have clearly said we must hold the election in line with the constitution, the existing rules and regulations.\" During dialogue with Islami Oikya Jote earlier at noon, Awal urged all political parties to have interparty dialogue to reach a consensus on stopping polls violence and the use of money and muscle power. \"We expect a consensus. It will be tough for the Election Commission to find a solution to the issues [polls violence, and the use of money and muscle power] unless there is a joint initiative of all political parties,\" Awal said. Amid backlash from different quarters, Awal yesterday offered \"apology\" for a controversial comment he made during talks with Nationalist Democratic Movement on Sunday. That day, he had said, \"If all political parties don't cooperate with us, we will fail. There needs to be a concerted effort. If someone comes with a sword, you will have to stand with a rifle or a sword. We will have command over the police and the government.\" The CEC also said they cannot stop violence alone. \"You [political parties] will have to take responsibility. Because you are the players... we are the referees.\" Yesterday, he blamed the media for \"distorting\" his comments. \"You have to understand that a chief election commissioner can never say this. Maybe I'm less educated. Even a less educated person can't talk like that. I said it as a joke. \"Sometimes, we make mistakes … Sorry for that. I went for a joke. I didn't mean it …\" He alleged that the media distorted his comments and damaged his dignity by spreading the statement knowingly or unknowingly. \"We have given the media free access… But as comments are being distorted, we have to rethink how open we will be to them,\" he added. During the talks, Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish proposed using ballot papers in the next general election, dissolving parliament before elections and deploying army personnel a week before the polls. Islami Oikya Jote called for deploying the army in \"sensitive areas\", and said the election-time government should perform only routine work and EVM should be used only after people's trust is earned. Ruling alliance partner Samyabadi Dal proposed using EVM in elections and keeping the local government, and the public administration and the home ministries under the EC during the election. The party's General Secretary Dilip Barua said it's not the EC's duty to bring all political parties to elections. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

Between July 7 and yesterday, DSEX, the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which has been on a declining trend since the start of this month, shed 150 points or 2.4 percent to close at 6,216.9. Yesterday, it dropped 87.4 points. \"Investors are tensed about the economic situation,\" said Abu Ahmed, a stock market analyst. Yesterday's announcement of a load-shedding plan heightened the investors' jitters as it heralds tougher days ahead. \"I have not seen such pessimism among investors in the last three years.\" As much as 90 percent of the stocks found no buyer yesterday, said Ahmed, a former chairman of Dhaka University's economics department. Turnover, an indicator of the level of activity in the bourse, stood at Tk 515.3 crore yesterday, down 13.2 percent from the previous day. \"Most are trying to dump their shares and wash their hands off the stock market for a while as they fear deepening challenges in the coming months,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage firm requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. Since the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission is not allowing any stock to drop more than 2 percent in a day, the index has been saved from registering massive drops. \"The global turmoil impacted the Bangladesh economy and that was reflected on the stock market,\" said Ershad Hossain, chief executive officer of City Bank Capital. Both the DS30, the blue-chip index; DSES, the Shariah index; and DSMEX, the SME index, dropped 31.7 points, 16.6 points and 189.9 points respectively yesterday. CASPI, the broad-based index of the port city's bourse, lost 242 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 18,280. Turnover at the CSE stood at Tk 13.61 crore yesterday, down from Tk 19.5 crore the previous day. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

On the other hand, Chief Returning Officer Prof Mohammad Zashim Uddin told The Daily Star, \"Even on the eve of the polls, if any criminal offence is found, the candidacy will be cancelled.

Kokichi Akuzawa, who was born in 1923, summited Japan's highest peak after climbing a mountain on an almost weekly basis as part of his training. His achievement in early August was recognised by Guinness World Records. \"I am six years older than the last time I climbed,\" Akuzawa told AFP, referring to his hike up the 3,776-metre (12,388 feet) peak at the age of 96. \"I have been there and seen the view many times, it wasn't anything special,\" he said. \"I reached the summit last time too.\" As well as an avid hiker, the retired livestock farmer from the central Gunma region volunteers at an elderly care centre and teaches painting. The preparation for the climb up Mount Fuji -- which is also an active volcano -- came after he tripped while walking up a mountain near his home in January and then fell ill with shingles and was hospitalised with heart failure. His physical condition worried his family, but Akuzawa was determined to climb, his daughter Yukiko, 75, told AFP. \"The recovery was so fast that his doctors could not believe it,\" Yukiko said. To get back into shape, Akuzawa woke up early every morning and set off on an hour-long walk, and also hiked up a mountain almost every week. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand While student union elections are scheduled next month at Dhaka University, Rajshahi University, and Jahangirnagar University, many other public universities remain uncertain about whether polls will ever be held, either due to legal bars or administrative delays. Some institutions are in talks with students and stakeholders, but students fear authorities are stalling instead of acting. Of 56 public universities across the country, only seven have the legal provision for a central students' union. Among those without legal provisions, Jagannath University has recently taken a step forward as its syndicate on Tuesday approved the long-awaited constitution for the central students' union. JnU Vice-Chancellor Prof Rezaul Karim said final procedures would be done within days before sending the draft to the education ministry. \"After the president issues an ordinance, we'll announce the election roadmap,\" he told reporters. Under the new framework, all regular students can vote and contest, with no age limit. The central students' union executive body will have 21 members, with hall unions also included. Similarly, Begum Rokeya University, Islamic University, Comilla University and Maulana Bhashani Science and Technology University lack provisions for unions. Students there are demanding amendments to their acts. At Rangpur's Begum Rokeya University, students launched a hunger strike on August 17. Nine fell sick within three days, with several hospitalised, though some later returned. VC Prof Showkat Ali said the university will hold elections once the act is updated. \"We forwarded letters to the authorities concerned on May 14 urging inclusion of student union polls in our act. But the UGC [University Grants Commission] delayed. If approved by September, we'll hold elections between October 26 and 31.\" At Maulana Bhashani University, a hunger strike began on August 12 and soon drew wider support. Protesters say repeated memorandums and meetings were ignored. VC Prof Anwarul Azim Akhand said, \"As there is no provision, we cannot arrange anything now. But we held a meeting with deans, chairmen, the proctor, and student welfare bodies, and decided to place the issue in the regent board meeting [on August 27].\" At Islamic University in Kushtia, students formed a platform named \"Movement for IUCSU\" after two rounds of discussions demanding inclusive representation, justice for the killing of a student, transparent teacher recruitment, protection for protesters, and minority participation. Leaders from Chhatra Dal, Chhatra Shibir, Chhatra Union, and Students Against Discrimination joined. \"This is a demand rooted in student rights. If the administration stalls, students will launch a tougher movement,\" said Shahed Ahmed of Chhatra Dal. IU Pro-VC Prof M Yeaqub Ali said he supports the demand but added, \"Since there is no provision, we must follow due process. If general students apply in writing, we will initiate discussions and approach the ministry, UGC, and the chancellor.\" At Barishal University, a July 22 referendum saw 86 percent of 1,145 participants support union polls. VC Prof Mohammad Taufiq Alam said the administration is \"positive\" but added, \"Not all students are demanding it. If general students jointly demand it, we will proceed.\" Chittagong University is among those that has legal provision for a central students' union. Though an election commission was formed, no schedule was announced. While authorities cited an incomplete voter list, with 11 of 54 departments yet to submit names, members of the Chhatra Odhikar Parishad locked the university's main gate on August 12, demanding a polls schedule. CU Pro-VC Prof Kamal Uddin said, \"Preparations are almost complete. We are ready to announce the poll schedule by Thursday.\" CU has held only six central elections, the last in 1990, since it was founded in 1966. Shahjalal University of Science and Technology last held polls in 1997. To revive them, authorities formed a seven-member committee on July 15 to re-draft the ordinance. VC Prof AM Sarwaruddin Chowdhury said, \"We are hopeful to hold the central union election. But as the last was 27 years ago, it would take time. Besides, under the current circumstances, hall polls may not be possible.\" Asked for a tentative date, he said, \"We're working to hold the election within December.\" Bangladesh Agricultural University last held polls in 1998. On August 26 this year, students submitted a memorandum with nine demands, including a full election schedule. VC Prof AK Fazlul Haque Bhuiyan said, \"The union election is a necessary component for students' rights. So far, only a handful submitted a memorandum. If we get demands from a majority of student bodies, we will work on it.\" Bangladesh Uni",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand The health ministry has moved to introduce a digital monitoring system to ensure that medical devices in public hospitals remain functional, with patients complaining of long delays in diagnosis and treatment due to equipment breakdowns. In the first phase, 300 medical devices in 114 government hospitals across the country will be brought under the \"Medical Equipment Maintenance Information and Monitoring System\" by December this year, said officials. Seven types of equipment have been selected for continuous monitoring, based on their critical role in diagnosing and treating serious illnesses, including cancer. The devices include MRI, CT Scan, X-ray and radiotherapy machines, they added. SUFFERINGS OF PATIENTS Sixty-one-year-old Sakina Begum travelled to Dhaka from Patuakhali in mid-July, seeking better medical care. Doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) advised her on July 28 to undergo radiotherapy without delay. But she had to wait nearly three weeks to receive the service as two of the three radiotherapy machines at the country's largest hospital have been non-functional for years. \"Had all three machines been operational, my mother could have received treatment on time,\" said Sakina's son Hadis Khan on Monday. \"We even contacted Barishal [Sher-e-Bangla] Medical College Hospital to know whether we can get the service there as it would be convenient for us. But we were told that the radiotherapy machine there also remains non-functional,\" he added. Like Sakina, Parvin Begum, a 50-year-old cancer patient from Narayanganj, had to wait for around 25 days for radiotherapy. A staff member of the radiotherapy department said one machine has been out of service for seven to eight years and another for five to six years. The only machine in operation now was also repaired a few months ago. Not only DMCH, but scores of other government hospitals across the country have been struggling to diagnose and treat patients as hundreds of medical devices remain non-functional, forcing many to seek costly services at private clinics, said health officials. The National Electro-Medical Equipment Maintenance Workshop and Training Center (NEMEMW & TC), a government agency, is responsible for repair and maintenance of medical equipment in around 700 government hospitals. Several officials at the agency said around 500 repair requisitions for medical devices, including high-tech equipment, are currently pending. However, the actual number of non-functional devices is likely to be much higher, as many hospitals delay submitting requisitions. Contacted, Jayanta Kumar Mukhopadhaya, chief technical manager of NEMEMW & TC, said they have floated a tender to repair 415 medical devices while inspections are going on to determine the problems with the rest. The process is taking more time than usual due to insufficient manpower, he said. At least 58 of the 95 posts at the agency remain vacant, Jayanta said, adding that the process of recruiting 55 staffers, including 19 assistant engineers, is underway and likely to be completed this year. SYSTEM TO BE LAUNCHED BY DEC\nThe Health Services Division on August 18 wrote to NEMEMW & TC, directing it to develop a system to monitor medical equipment in public hospitals.\nSayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser for the health ministry, said that once put in place, the system would enhance the authorities' capacity to ensure uninterrupted services of high-tech equipment at public hospitals.\n\"It will give us real-time updates…We will be able to intervene promptly as the system will continue to send alerts until the device is repaired,\" he told The Daily Star on August 23.\nJayanta Kumar said that in the first phase, the agency will monitor high-tech and costly medical devices in 114 government hospitals, including all district and specialised hospitals.\nAround Tk 30 crore may be required for the project that will cover equipment worth approximately Tk 2,000 crore.\nHe said that once they get administrative and financial approval from the ministry, a tender will be floated to hire a vendor. The system is expected to be launched by December.\nHOW WILL THE SYSTEM WORK?\nTwo officials of NEMEMW & TC said they will install monitoring devices on medical equipment to track electricity consumption levels for each machine.\nExplaining the mechanism, they said a piece of equipment consumes a certain amount of electricity under normal conditions, and the level of consumption increases when it is in use. However, electricity usage drops to nearly zero when the equipment becomes non-functional.\nOnce a machine becomes non-functional, the installed monitoring device will send a signal to the monitoring systems at the hospital, NEMEMW & TC, the Directorate General of He",

The Rucsu polls will now be held on September 25, three days earlier than the previously set date of September 28. Voting will take place at the academic buildings, with results to be declared the same day. Confirming the matter, Prof F Nazrul Islam, chief election commissioner, told The Daily Star that other dates in the revised schedule will also be adjusted accordingly. \"Since the 28th is the holy Maha Shashti [the beginning of Durga Puja], we are pushing the election date forward out of respect. The complete schedule will be announced later tonight [Wednesday].\" He further said, \"After hearing that the election was scheduled for the 28th, students started protesting. Considering the matter, we have decided to change the date.\" Earlier in the day, students protested, saying the timing would disenfranchise thousands of students. RU student Sourav Karmakar said, \"We strongly protest this decision. Not just Hindu students, most of the campus will remain empty that day. Who will cast their votes then? We demand that the administration ensures no one is deprived of their voting rights.\" Fuad Ratul, convener of the Socialist Students' Front, added, \"Because of Durga Puja festivities and university holidays, many students will be unable to vote. This exclusion will give fundamentalist groups an undue advantage.\" Rajshahi University Chhatra Dal president Sultan Ahmed Rahi posted on social media, \"Fixing the Rucsu polls on the eve of Durga Puja is no coincidence—it is a deliberate conspiracy.\" Mujahid Faisal, general secretary of the Shibir unit, said, \"We believe the commission made this unilateral decision under pressure from a particular group as part of a plan to sabotage the election. Other organisations and candidates are dissatisfied. We hope the commission will withdraw this announcement and hold the election at the originally scheduled time.\" Kaiser Ahmed, treasurer of the Chhatra Union, added, \"The extension of the election timeline and the new polling date are the result of influence from two partisan organisations. This move will exclude a large portion of students and make a fair, participatory election impossible.\" সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir yesterday alleged that a certain political quarter is deliberately trying to prevent pro-democracy forces from assuming power. He said these disrupting forces were raising new demands only to disrupt the electoral process. \"We fought a war in 1971. We have not forgotten it -- and it is not possible to forget. Yet, efforts are being made to erase it from people's memory,\" he said, adding that those who collaborated with the occupying forces back then have once again become vocal. \"We must remain very alert and careful. If we think we have won and everything is fine, then it will be a big mistake.\" Fakhrul made the remarks at a programme at the Jatiya Press Club, marking the 10th death anniversary of veteran politician Kazi Zafar Ahmed. The BNP leader said his party had fully cooperated with the interim government since its inception and had neither created obstacles nor raised demands on the streets to embarrass it. \"But, unfortunately, some political quarters are intentionally trying to foil and disrupt the polls by raising new demands,\" he said. Saying reforms are difficult for the general population to grasp, the BNP leader said the proportional representation (PR) system in voting is even more difficult to explain to them. \"Moreover, voters would not know who they are voting for [in the PR system]. Yet, many are speaking about implementing these measures and issuing threats,\" he added. Expressing regret, Fakhrul said the anticipated change in mindset after last year's uprising had not materialised. \"I have never felt depressed in politics; I was never frustrated. I have always given courage to everyone. But, recently, a shadow of despair has crept into me. You may ask why? Wherever I look, most people have become spoiled.\" He said corruption has worsened and bemoaned the complicity of political leaders. \"Corruption… you cannot go to any office or court. An industrialist told me that before he had to pay one lakh taka, now he has to pay five lakh. What this means is, the change that was supposed to come in people's mindset has not come.\" Alleging that those who seek to derail the polls are exploiting the situation, Fakhrul demanded that the government must hold polls without delay. \"Very quickly finish the July charter, reforms, without adding more complications. Make arrangements for the polls quickly. Make the political parties election-oriented,\" he said. \"There is no alternative to elections.\" Expressing frustration over the attack on Adviser Mahfuz Alam, he said, \"Awami League people are harassing and attacking an adviser. Where will we go?\" Referring to recent reports, Fakhrul said, \"A Bangladeshi, known for bank looting, has given Tk 2,500 crore to Sheikh Hasina in Delhi. They are now planning how to use that money to stop Bangladesh's election and bring Hasina back again.\" He also highlighted the ongoing liquidity crisis in banks. \"Today, my wife called the bank to withdraw some money. The bank officials said, 'sorry madam, we cannot give more than Tk 5,000'\". \"These problems could have been avoided if the polls were held within three months,\" he said, adding that he had faced criticism for making that demand soon after the uprising. \"We have seen whenever there is a change, others take advantage of it. And the more delay there is in the democratic transition, in holding elections, the more that advantage increases,\" Fakhrul warned. He also recalled that the 1/11 military-backed caretaker government had stayed in power for two years and \"handed over power to the fascist Awami League.\" সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

The 38-year-old Djokovic dropped the first set but recovered to win 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 and stay in the hunt for an unprecedented 25th Grand Slam singles title. \"I wasn't really happy about my tennis for the first part of the match but also credit to Zach for playing some high quality tennis,\" said Djokovic. The Serbian star admitted to feeling \"not that great\" after a laboured performance but is optimistic he will gradually find his rhythm. \"That's what I'm hoping, the deeper I go into the tournament the better I feel about my game,\" he said. \"Obviously a bit different for me the last couple of years body-wise. I get the wear and tear quicker than I used to do.\" Djokovic, a four-time champion in New York, made a sluggish start against his 145th-ranked opponent who had won just two main-draw matches at majors. The 22-year-old Svajda snatched a tight first set in a tie-break when he smacked a bruising backhand down the line that Djokovic could not return. Seventh seed Djokovic broke for a 4-2 lead in the second set on the way to levelling up the match in bright sunshine on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic dropped serve early in the third set but then rattled off five consecutive games to grab the set after falling 3-1 behind. With Svajda wilting and receiving treatment to both legs, Djokovic pulled away to victory by winning 11 of the final 12 games to register a record-tying 191st hard-court match win at Grand Slams. He also surpassed the mark he shared with Roger Federer by making the last 32 of a major for the 75th time. He will next play Britain's Cam Norrie or Francisco Comesana of Argentina. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

While Australia fell to a 2-1 series defeat at home against South Africa, the reigning ICC Men's Cricket World Cup winners were rewarded on the latest rankings release following their emphatic victory in the series finale in Mackay. The Aussies amassed a whopping total of 431/2 in the 50-over contest, with a trio of their batters in Travis Head (142), Mitch Marsh (100) and Cameron Green (118*) cashing in with a century. All three made good ground on the rankings for ODI batters as a result, with Head gaining one place to move to equal 11th, Marsh jumping four rungs to move to 44th and Green rising a whopping 40 slots to be 78th. Australian teammate Josh Inglis also makes ground on the list for ODI batters, with the right-hander improving 23 spots to move to 64th as a result of his innings of 87 during the second match of the series against the Proteas. India duo Shubman Gill (784 rating points) and Rohit Sharma (756) remain at the top of the rankings for ODI batters, with Pakistan right-hander Babar Azam (739) rounding out the top three. Things are even tighter at the top of the rankings for ODI bowlers, with Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana joining fellow tweaker Keshav Maharaj at the top on 671 rating points following the completion of the series between South Africa and Australia. Maharaj lost ground after picking up figures of 1/57 in the series finale, with his rating dropping equal with Theekshana even as the Sri Lankan spinner didn't feature across the week. The biggest mover on the ODI rankings for bowlers came via Lungi Ngidi, with the South Africa speedster gaining six places to move to 28th following his series-high seven scalps across the three games against Australia. Australia duo Sean Abbott (up nine places to equal 48th) and Nathan Ellis (up 21 spots to 65th) also made ground on the list for ODI bowlers following some decent showings during the series with the Proteas. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

World governing body FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) sent a joint letter to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey expressing \"profound concern\" at the continued failure to finalise and adopt the constitution. \"Failure to meet this schedule will leave us with no alternative but to refer the matter to the relevant FIFA decision-making body for consideration and decision,\" said the letter, seen by AFP. \"AIFF must regard this communication as binding and requiring immediate compliance in order to safeguard its rights as a member of FIFA and the AFC,\" it added.

FIFA previously suspended India in August 2022 for third-party influence after the Supreme Court appointed a committee of administrators to run the AIFF. The ban was lifted a few days later, paving the way for the AIFF to elect Chaubey. India's top-flight club football is currently in disarray. The Indian Super League (ISL) could fold over a dispute between the AIFF and its commercial partner. This season's ISL kickoff has been delayed with thousands of players and staff in danger of losing their jobs. A rights agreement between the AIFF and the company that runs the ISL, Football Sports Development Limited, ends on December 8 and is yet to be renewed The AIFF has been unable to come up with a revival plan for the ISL, which is usually played between September and April. Players union FIFPRO Asia/Oceania raised the issue with FIFA last week. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

The league also ran a video clip of Swift with Kelce as Super Bowl victory confetti was falling behind them, the singer saying, \"This is so crazy. I cannot believe this is really happening. I'm in shock,\" with an NFL caption reading, \"Same.\" Chiefs defensive end Michael Danna, who was having a news conference at the time the engagement news went public, said: \"I don't know nothing.\" \"Man, it's incredible.

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand Australia great Justin Langer has implored England to continue their attacking approach when they try and break their long drought away from home in the battle for the Ashes later this year. England have won just one Ashes series in Australia since 1987 and have failed to taste success in a single Test match in their three most recent trips Down Under. While England have had mixed results of late and currently sit in fourth place in the ICC World Test Championship standings following their recent 2-2 against India at home, Langer wants to see the side take a different approach when they arrive in Australia later this year in the battle for the Ashes across five Tests. Langer believes England have been dictated to by Australia's bowlers in recent away tours and wants to see their batters take on the high quality Aussie pace attack when the first Test commences in Perth on November 21. \"Call it Bazball or the aggressive approach, but I think England must play that approach in Australia. No question, because it'll put pressure back on,\" Langer told the BBC Sounds' For the Love of Cricket podcast. \"The only players who had success against Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath were those who attacked them. They got back in their face and they hated it because no one did it. \"It's going to take courage because you have got Mitchell Starc bowling like he does, Josh Hazlewood never misses the spot and Pat Cummins is a generational bowler. So it's going to take great courage.\" The most recent Ashes series ended tied at 2-2 in the middle of 2023 and Langer is concerned whether England lack the killer punch to put away the Aussies when the opportunity arises. \"It's going to be a really, really close series,\" Langer predicted. \"My question for England will be, have you got the killer instinct to finish off a series if you get a chance? \"We've seen it, the two-all here in the last Ashes series, two-all against India. \"England had the chances to win that series. Have you got the killer instinct to win the Ashes in Australia? That's going to be the big question.\" First Test: Perth Stadium, November 21-25 Second Test: Gabba, December 4-8 Third Test: Adelaide Oval, December 17-21 Fourth Test: MCG, December 26-30 Fifth Test: SCG, January 4-8 সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

    "content": "How a train to Tehran is rewriting the world’s map Shariful becomes first Bangladeshi-American brigadier general in US Air Force Cocaine haul raises transit route concerns Buet students block Shahbagh with three-point demand Bangladesh's batting often leans on skipper Nigar Sultana Joty, but much will also depend on experienced opener Farzana Haque Pinky in the ICC Women's World Cup, to be held in India and Sri Lanka from September 30 to November 2. Farzana -- Bangladesh's top run-scorer in the previous edition in New Zealand in 2022, with 173 runs in seven matches -- recently spoke to The Daily Star's Samsul Arefin Khan about preparations and expectations for the marquee event. Excerpts from the interview are as follows: The Daily Star (DS): How satisfied are you with overall preparation? Farzana Haque Pinky (FHP): We've been preparing for a long time, but… ultimately, the quality of our preparation will show in the World Cup, which arrives every four years -- unlike the [biennial] T20 World Cup -- so we're determined to make it count. DS: You're playing in the Challenge Cup at Savar's BKSP. Is it ideal preparation for the sporting wickets you'll see at the World Cup? FHP: At first, the [BKSP] wickets were too bad, but the groundsmen worked hard to make those playable. I've built the mindset that we can't use pitches as an excuse, having played on these conditions for 15 years. Australia and New Zealand always bat on flat wickets, and that's why their mindset is different. We must prepare by adjusting to what we get. DS: What are this team's strengths and weaknesses? FHP: Our strength is that everyone knows we can only succeed as a team, not as individuals. Joty is a fantastic player, but she knows she can't win matches alone. In our victories, contributions have come from across the side. We don't have a super batter striking at 100-150 to finish games single-handedly, but our spin attack is world-class. The weakness is pace -- if the board invests in developing fast bowlers, we could become a much more complete side. DS: You're often criticised for low strike rate. How do you see it? FHP: At home, we usually play on slow, low wickets. My role is to anchor the innings. I accept I take time to settle, but my focus is always on putting the team in a strong position. Since the West Indies tour, I've worked on rotating the strike and improving my powerplay batting, even taking help from personal coaches. In the qualifiers, you could see progress; especially in Powerplay. DS: This will be your second World Cup. Your goal? FHP: We are going with high expectations. I won't claim we'll do something extraordinary, but if everyone contributes, we can achieve plenty. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

The five-time Champions League winner joins on a free transfer, having been a free agent since his Madrid contract expired in the summer. The 34-year-old completed a medical in Madrid and is in line to play in Leverkusen's next match, away at Werder Bremen on Saturday. In a statement, Vazquez said he was \"looking forward to continuing my career at Leverkusen\". Vazquez revealed former Leverkusen coach and current Real manager Xabi Alonso and one-time Leverkusen player Dani Carvajal, who is now at Madrid, helped convince him to join the German side. \"With Lucas Vazquez we are signing an extremely experienced player who has won everything there was to win with Real Madrid over the past ten years,\" said Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes, adding the newcomer would become \"a pillar\" of the side. Leverkusen were looking for a right-back after Jeremie Frimpong's move to Liverpool at the end of last season. Other than a short stint at Espanyol, Vazquez spent his entire career with Real Madrid, winning four La Liga titles. Trent Alexander-Arnold's arrival at Real meant Vazquez fell lower in the pecking order at right back, but the nine-time capped Spanish player wanted to continue his career. Unbeaten domestic double winners two seasons ago, Leverkusen have undergone a complete rebuild this summer, with several key players leaving the club. Florian Wirtz, Granit Xhaka and Frimpong have all left for the Premier League, Jonathan Tah joined league rivals Bayern Munich and coach Xabi Alonso moved to Real Madrid. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

Inter Miami assistant coach Javier Morales said the Herons will monitor both Messi and Jordi Alba before deciding whether they will be available for Wednesday's home showdown against Orlando City. \"Jordi and Leo trained with us, they completed training. We'll see how they feel as the day progresses, and tomorrow we'll make a decision,\" Morales said. Morales called Messi completing his training workout \"super positive\" and added, \"I imagine he'll be in the squad at least.\" The Miami-Orlando winner will face the winner of Wednesday's other semifinal between the reigning MLS champion Los Angeles Galaxy and Seattle Sounders in Sunday's title game of the event, which included MLS and Mexican league clubs. Messi, 38, sparked Miami to the 2023 Leagues Cup crown in his early days in South Florida. But Messi missed Miami's quarterfinal victory a week ago over Tigres with a \"minor\" right leg muscle injury and did not play Saturday in Miami's MLS draw at DC United. Alba suffered a knee injury and departed in the second half against Tigres  but both he and Messi handled practice with teammates on Monday and Tuesday. Messi last played for the Herons in a reserve role against the Galaxy on August 16, scoring one goal and setting up another in Miami's triumph. \"Whether Messi is or is not playing, I feel like we'll have the same mentality -- just to go out there and be the best and try and win,\" Orlando back Alex Freeman said. One guaranteed absentee for the Orlando-Miami showdown is Inter head coach Javier Mascherano, who was issued a red card in the Tigres match. Orlando have won both matches against Miami this season by a combind 7-1 margin, including a 4-1 rout earlier this month. \"We know there's a different setting prior to this match,\" Orlando coach Oscar Pareja said. \"But we have the same energy, the same strength, the same desire that has always characterized us in previous derbies.\" Morales said: \"It's probably the most important clasico that we're going to play so far.\" সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said last week more time and tests were needed to gain clarity on Havertz's injury. Havertz, 26, was also sidelined for over three months after suffering a hamstring injury in February. Arsenal signed forward Eberechi Eze on Saturday to bolster their attack in the absence of Havertz and Gabriel Jesus, who is yet to return since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury last season. সরকারি হাসপাতালের চিকিৎসা সরঞ্জাম সচল আছে কি না তা পর্যবেক্ষণ করতে ডিজিটাল মনিটরিং সিস্টেম চালুর উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে স্বাস্থ্য মন্ত্রণালয়।",

Swiatek had barely had time to leave the Arthur Ashe Stadium showcourt following her 6-1, 6-2 drubbing of Emiliana Arango before news of Swift & Kelce's plans to tie the knot filtered through to Flushing Meadows in New York. Swiatek's win on Tuesday made her the first woman in history to win 65 consecutive WTA-level first-round games, surpassing Monica Seles' previous record of 64. The 24-year-old world number two from Poland -- regarded as a favourite to win her second US Open title -- is a famously devoted fan of Swift's music, previously revealing that the US singer's music helped her learn English and navigate her adolescence. Swiatek also attended Swift's money-spinning 'Eras Tour' last year, attending a concert in Liverpool following her victory at the French Open -- a win that earned her a handwritten note of congratulations from the singer. Unsurprisingly, Swift's looming nuptials dominated the discussion in Swiatek's post-match press conference. The first nine questions to Swiatek from journalists related to Swift & Kelce's engagement. \"I'm just happy for her, because she deserves the best,\" Swiatek said. \"Obviously she had a lot of boyfriends, so we know all about that. So hopefully this one will, stick forever. Travis seems like a great guy. She seems super happy, so I'm happy for her. I wish them all the best,\" she added.
